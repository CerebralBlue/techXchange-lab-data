0	1	History of Idaho - wikipedia History of Idaho The history of Idaho is an examination of the human history and social activity within the state of Idaho , one of the United States of America located in the Pacific Northwest area near the west coast of the United States and Canada . Other associated areas include southern Alaska , all of British Columbia , Washington , Oregon , western Montana and northern California and Nevada .

Excavations in 1959 at Wilson Butte Cave near Twin Falls revealed evidence of human activity , including arrowheads , that rank among the oldest dated artifacts in North America . American Indian tribes predominant in the area in historic times included the Nez Perce and the Coeur d'Alene in the north ; and the Northern and Western Shoshone and Bannock peoples in the south .

Location Cataldo , Idaho Built 1848 Architect Antonio Ravalli Architectural style Greek Revival , Colonial , Other NRHP reference # 66000312 Significant dates Added to NRHP October 15 , 1966 Designated NHL July 4 , 1961 Idaho was one of the last areas in the lower 48 states of the US to be explored by people of European descent . The Lewis and Clark expedition entered present - day Idaho on August 12 , 1805 , at Lemhi Pass . It is believed that the first `` European descent '' expedition to enter southern Idaho was by a group led in 1811 and 1812 by Wilson Price Hunt , which navigated the Snake River while attempting to blaze an all - water trail westward from St. Louis , Missouri , to Astoria , Oregon . At that time , approximately 8,000 Native Americans lived in the region . Fur trading led to the first significant incursion of Europeans in the region . Andrew Henry of the Missouri Fur Company first entered the Snake River plateau in 1810 . He built Fort Henry on Henry 's Fork on the upper Snake River , near modern St. Anthony , Idaho . However , this first American fur post west of the Rocky Mountains was abandoned the following spring . The British - owned Hudson 's Bay Company next entered Idaho and controlled the trade in the Snake River area by the 1820s . The North West Company 's interior department	History of Idaho
2	3	of the Columbia was created in June 1816 , and Donald Mackenzie was assigned as its head . Mackenzie had previously been employed by Hudson 's Bay and had been a partner in the Pacific Fur Company , financed principally by John Jacob Astor . During these early years , he traveled west with a Pacific Fur Company 's party and was involved in the initial exploration of the Salmon River and Clearwater River . The company proceeded down the lower Snake River and Columbia River by canoe , and were the first of the Overland Astorians to reach Fort Astoria , on January 18 , 1812 . Under Mackenzie , the North West Company was a dominant force in the fur trade in the Snake River country . Out of Fort George in Astoria , Mackenzie led fur brigades up the Snake River in 1816 - 1817 and up the lower Snake in 1817 - 1818 . Fort Nez Perce , established in July , 1818 , became the staging point for Mackenzies ' Snake brigades . The expedition of 1818 - 1819 explored the Blue Mountains , and traveled down the Snake River to the Bear River and approached the headwaters of the Snake . Mackenzie sought to establish a navigable route up the Snake River from Fort Nez Perce to the Boise area in 1819 . While he did succeed in traveling by boat from the Columbia River through the Grand Canyon of the Snake past Hells	History of Idaho
3	4	Canyon , he concluded that water transport was generally impractical . Mackenzie held the first rendezvous in the region on the Boise River in 1819 . Despite their best efforts , early American fur companies in this region had difficulty maintaining the long - distance supply lines from the Missouri River system into the Intermountain West . However , Americans William H. Ashley and Jedediah Smith expanded the Saint Louis fur trade into Idaho in 1824 . The 1832 trapper 's rendezvous at Pierre 's Hole , held at the foot of the Three Tetons in modern Teton County , was followed by an intense battle between the Gros Ventre and a large party of American trappers aided by their Nez Perce and Flathead allies . The prospect of missionary work among the Native Americans also attracted early settlers to the region . In 1809 , Kullyspell House , the first white - owned establishment and first trading post in Idaho , was constructed . In 1836 , the Reverend Henry H. Spalding established a Protestant mission near Lapwai , where he printed the Northwest 's first book , established Idaho 's first school , developed its first irrigation system , and grew the state 's first potatoes . Narcissa Whitman and Eliza Hart Spalding were the first non-native women to enter present - day Idaho . Cataldo Mission , the oldest standing building in Idaho , was constructed at Cataldo by the Coeur d'Alene and Catholic missionaries . In	History of Idaho
4	5	1842 , Father Pierre - Jean De Smet , with Fr. Nicholas Point and Br . Charles Duet , selected a mission location along the St. Joe River . The mission was moved a short distance away in 1846 , as the original location was subject to flooding . In 1850 , Antonio Ravalli designed a new mission building and Indians affiliated with the church effort built the mission , without nails , using the wattle and daub method . In time , the Cataldo mission became an important stop for traders , settlers , and miners . In addition to acting as a place for rest from the trail , the mission offered needed supplies and was a working port for boats heading up the Coeur d'Alene River . During this time , the region which became Idaho was part of an unorganized territory known as Oregon Country , claimed by both the United States and Great Britain . The United States gained undisputed jurisdiction over the region in the Oregon Treaty of 1846 , although the area was under the de facto jurisdiction of the Provisional Government of Oregon from 1843 to 1849 . The original boundaries of Oregon Territory in 1848 included all three of the present - day Pacific Northwest states and extended eastward to the Continental Divide . In 1853 , areas north of the 46th Parallel became Washington Territory , splitting what is now Idaho in two . The future state was reunited in	History of Idaho
5	6	1859 after Oregon became a state and the boundaries of Washington Territory were redrawn . While thousands passed through Idaho on the Oregon Trail or during the California gold rush of 1849 , few people settled there . In 1860 , the first of several gold rushes in Idaho began at Pierce in present - day Clearwater County . By 1862 , settlements in both the north and south had formed around the mining boom . Settlement ( edit ) Mormon settlers ( edit ) Mormon missionaries founded Fort Lemhi in 1855 , but the settlement did not last . The first organized town in Idaho was Franklin , settled in April 1860 by Mormon pioneers who believed they were in Utah Territory ; although a later survey determined they had in fact crossed the border . Mormon pioneers would go on to establish the majority of historic and modern communities in Southeastern Idaho , with Mormon settlers reaching areas near the current - day Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming . Settlements include Ammon , Blackfoot , Chubbuck , Firth , Idaho Falls , Iona , Pocatello , Rexburg , Rigby , Shelley , and Ucon See Mormon Corridor . English ( edit ) Large numbers of English immigrants settled in what is now the state of Idaho in the late 19th and early 20th century , many before statehood . The English found they had more property rights and paid less taxes than they did back in England	History of Idaho
6	7	. They were considered some of the most desirable immigrants at the time . Many came from humble beginnings and would rise to prominence in Idaho such as Frank R. Gooding who was originally from a rural working - class background in England but was eventually elected as the seventh governor of the state . Today people of English descent make up one fifth of the entire state of Idaho and form a plurality in the southern portion of the state . German ( edit ) Many German farmers settled in what is now Idaho at the same time . German settlers were primarily Lutheran across all of the midwest and west , including Idaho , however there were small amounts of Catholics amongst them as well . In parts of Northern Idaho , German remained the dominant language until World War I , when German - Americans were pressured to convert entirely to English . Today , Idahoans of German ancestry make up nearly one fifth of all Idahoans and make up the second largest ethnic group after Idahoans of English descent with people of German ancestry being 18.1 % of the state and people of English ancestry being 20.1 % of the state . Irish ( edit ) A significant number of people from Ireland immigrated to North America after the Potato Famine , and some migrated west searching for land for agriculture . Many ended up in Montana and southern Idaho . Because the Catholic Church already	History of Idaho
7	8	had a presence in the northern and eastern portions of the state , many Irish Catholics settled in Boise as well as in Butte , Montana . Today , 10 % of Idahoans self - identify as being of Irish ancestry . African ( edit ) York , a slave owned by William Clark but considered a full member of Corps of Discovery during expedition to the Pacific , was the first recorded African American in Idaho . There is a significant African American population made up of those who came west after the abolition of slavery . Many settled near Pocatello and were ranchers , entertainers , and farmers . Although free , many blacks suffered discrimination in the early - to - mid-late 20th century . The black population of the state continues to grow as many come to the state because of educational opportunities , to serve in the military , and for other employment opportunities . There is a Black History Museum in Boise , Idaho , with an exhibit known as the `` Invisible Idahoan '' , which chronicles the first African - Americans in the state . Blacks are the fourth largest ethnic group in Idaho according to the 2000 census . Mountain Home , Boise , and Garden City have significant African - American populations . However , many major cities , such as Boise , have a small population of African Americans . Basque ( edit ) The Basque people from the	History of Idaho
8	9	Iberian peninsula in Spain and southern France were traditionally shepherds in Europe . They came to Idaho , offering hard work and perseverance in exchange for opportunity . One of the largest Basque communities in the US is in Boise , with a Basque museum and festival held annually in the city . Chinese settlement ( edit ) Chinese in the mid-19th century came to America through San Francisco to work on the railroad and open businesses . They suffered discrimination due to the Anti-Chinese League in the 19th century which sought to limit the rights and opportunities of Chinese emigrants . Today Asians are third in population demographically after Whites and Hispanics . Idaho Territory ( edit ) Main article : Idaho Territory Seal of Idaho Territory 1863 - 1866 Seal of Idaho Territory 1866 - 1890 On March 4 , 1863 , President Abraham Lincoln signed an act creating Idaho Territory from portions of Washington Territory and Dakota Territory with its capital at Lewiston . The original Idaho Territory included most of the areas that later became the states of Idaho , Montana and Wyoming , and had a population of under 17,000 . Idaho Territory assumed the boundaries of the modern state in 1868 and was admitted as a state in 1890 . Statehood ( edit ) When President Benjamin Harrison signed the law admitting Idaho as a U.S. state on July 3 , 1890 , the population was 88,548 . George L. Shoup became the state	History of Idaho
9	10	's first governor , but resigned after only a few weeks in office to take a seat in the United States Senate . Miners ' uprisings ( edit ) During its first years of statehood , Idaho was plagued by labor unrest in the mining district of Coeur d'Alene . In 1892 , miners called a strike which developed into a shooting war between union miners and company guards . Each side accused the other of starting the fight . The first shots were exchanged at the Frisco mine in Frisco , in the Burke - Canyon north and east of Wallace . The Frisco mine was blown up , and company guards were taken prisoner . The violence soon spilled over into the nearby community of Gem , where union miners attempted to locate a Pinkerton spy who had infiltrated their union and was passing information to the mine operators . But agent Charlie Siringo escaped by cutting a hole in the floor of his room . Strikers forced the Gem mine to close , then traveled west to the Bunker Hill mining complex near Wardner , and closed down that facility as well . Several had been killed in the Burke - Canyon fighting . The Idaho National Guard and federal troops were dispatched to the area , and union miners and sympathizers were thrown into bullpens . Hostilities would again erupt at the Bunker Hill facility in 1899 , when seventeen union miners were fired for having	History of Idaho
10	11	joined the union . Other union miners were likewise ordered to draw their pay and leave . Angry members of the union converged on the area and blew up the Bunker Hill Mill , killing two company men . In both disputes , the union 's complaints included pay , hours of work , the right of miners to belong to the union , and the mine owners ' use of informants and undercover agents . The violence committed by union miners was answered with a brutal response in 1892 and in 1899 . Through the Western Federation of Miners ( WFM ) union , the battles in the mining district became closely tied to a major miners ' strike in Colorado . The struggle culminated in the December 1905 assassination of former Governor Frank Steunenberg by Harry Orchard ( also known as Albert Horsley ) , a member of the WFM . Orchard was allegedly incensed by Steunenberg 's efforts as governor to put down the 1899 miner uprising after being elected on a pro-labor platform . Pinkerton detective James McParland conducted the investigation into the assassination . In 1907 , WFM Secretary Treasurer `` Big Bill '' Haywood and two other WFM leaders were tried on a charge of conspiracy to murder Steunenberg , with Orchard testifying against them as part of a deal made with McParland . The nationally publicized trial featured Senator William E. Borah as prosecuting attorney and Clarence Darrow representing the defendants . The	History of Idaho
11	12	defense team presented evidence that Orchard had been a Pinkerton agent and had acted as a paid informant for the Cripple Creek Mine Owners ' Association . Darrow argued that Orchard 's real motive in the assassination had been revenge for a declaration of martial law by Steunenberg , which prompted Orchard to gamble away a share in the Hercules silver mine that would otherwise have made him wealthy . Two of the WFM leaders were acquitted in two separate trials , and the third was released . Orchard was convicted and sentenced to death . His sentence was commuted , and he spent the rest of his life in an Idaho prison . Mining in Idaho ( edit ) Mining in Idaho was a major commercial venture , bringing a great of attention to the state . From 1860 - 1866 Idaho produced 19 % of all gold in the United States , or 2.5 million ounces . Most of Idaho 's mining production , 1860 -- 1969 , has come from metals equating to $2.88 billion out of $3.42 billion , according to the best estimates . Of the metallic mining areas of Idaho , the Coeur d'Alene region has produced the most by far , and accounts for about 80 % of the total Idaho yield . Mining regions ( edit ) Several others -- Boise Basin , Wood River Valley , Stibnite , Blackbirg , and Owyhee -- range considerably above the other big producers .	History of Idaho
12	13	Atlanta , Bear Valley , Bay Horse , Florence , Gilmore , Mackay , Patterson , and Yankee Fork all ran on the order of ten to twenty million dollars , and Elk City , Leesburg , Pierce , Rocky Bar , and Warren 's make up the rest of the major Idaho mining areas that stand out in the sixty or so regions of production worthy of mention . A number of small operations do not appear in this list of Idaho metallic mining areas : a small amount of gold was recovered from Goose Creek on Salmon Meadows ; a mine near Cleveland was prospected in 1922 and produced a little manganese in 1926 ; a few tons of copper came from Fort Hall , and a few more tons of copper came from a mine near Montpelier . Similarly , a few tons of lead came from a property near Bear Lake , and lead - silver is known on Cassia Creek near Elba . Some gold quartz and lead - silver workings are on Ruby Creek west of Elk River , and there is a slightly developed copper operation on Deer Creek near Winchester . Molybdenum is known on Roaring River and on the east fork of the Salmon . Some scattered mining enterprises have been undertaken around Soldier Mountain and on Squaw Creek north of Montour . Progressive policies ( edit ) Idaho proved to be one of the more receptive states to the progressive	History of Idaho
13	14	agenda of the late 19th century and early 20th century . The state embraced progressive policies such as women 's suffrage ( 1896 ) and prohibition ( 1916 ) before they became federal law . Idahoans were also strongly supportive of Free Silver . The pro-bimetallism Populist and Silver Republican parties of the late 1890s were particularly successful in the state . Eugenics was also a major part of the Progressive movement . In 1919 , the Idaho legislature passed an Act legalizing the forced sterilization of some persons institutionalized in the state . The act was vetoed by governor D.W. Davis , who doubted its scientific merits and believed it likely violated the Equal Protection clause of the US Constitution . In 1925 , the Idaho legislature passed a revised eugenics act , now tailored to avoid Davis 's earlier objections . The new law created a state board of eugenics , charged with : the sterilization of all feebleminded , insane , epileptics , habitual criminals , moral degenerates and sexual perverts who are a menace to society , and providing the means for ascertaining who are such persons . The Eugenics board was eventually folded into the state 's health commission ; between 1932 and 1964 , a total of 30 women and eight men in Idaho were sterilized under this law . The sterilization law was formally repealed in 1972 . All female survey crew - Minidoka Project , Idaho 1918 After statehood , Idaho 's	History of Idaho
14	15	economy began a gradual shift away from mining toward agriculture , particularly in the south . Older mining communities such as Silver City and Rocky Bar gave way to agricultural communities incorporated after statehood , such as Nampa and Twin Falls . Milner Dam on the Snake River , completed in 1905 , allowed for the formation of many agricultural communities in the Magic Valley region which had previously been nearly unpopulated . Meanwhile , some of the mining towns were able to reinvent themselves as resort communities , most notably in Blaine County , where the Sun Valley ski resort opened in 1936 . Others , such as Silver City and Rocky Bar , became ghost towns . 1950s to present ( edit ) In the north , mining continued to be an important industry for several more decades . The closure of the Bunker Hill Mine complex in Shoshone County in the early 1980s sent the region 's economy into a tailspin . Since that time , a substantial increase in tourism in north Idaho has helped the region to recover . Coeur d'Alene , a lake - side resort town , is a destination for visitors in the area . Beginning in the 1980s , there was a rise in North Idaho of a few right - wing extremist and `` survivalist '' political groups , most notably one holding Neo-Nazi views , the Aryan Nations . These groups were most heavily concentrated in the Panhandle region	History of Idaho
15	16	of the state , particularly in the vicinity of Coeur d'Alene . In 1992 a stand - off occurred between U.S. Marshals , the F.B.I. , and white separatist Randy Weaver and his family at their compound at Ruby Ridge , located near the small , northern Idaho town of Naples . The ensuing fire - fight and deaths of a U.S. Marshal , and Weaver 's son and wife gained national attention , and raised a considerable amount of controversy regarding the nature of acceptable force by the federal government in such situations . In 2001 , the Aryan Nations compound , which had been located in Hayden Lake , Idaho , was confiscated as a result of a court case , and the organization moved out of state . About the same time Boise installed an impressive stone Human Rights Memorial featuring a bronze statue of Anne Frank and quotations from her and many other writers extolling human freedom and equality . A recent poll found that Idaho citizens accept people of different cultures and ethnicities . The demographics of the state have changed . Due to this growth in different groups , especially in Boise , the economic expansion surged wrong - economic growth followed the high standard of living and resulted in the `` growth of different groups '' . The population of Idaho in the 21st Century has been described as sharply divided along geographic and cultural lines due to the center of the state	History of Idaho
16	17	being dominated by sparsely - populated national forests , mountain ranges and recreation sites : `` unless you 're willing to navigate a treacherous mountain pass , you ca n't even drive from the north to the south without leaving the state . '' The northern population gravitates towards Spokane , Washington , the heavily Mormon south - east population towards Utah , with an isolated Boise `` ( being ) the closest thing to a city - state that you 'll find in America . '' Nuclear fallout from Nevada Test site ( edit ) Per capita thyroid doses in the continental United States of iodine - 131 resulting from all exposure routes from all atmospheric nuclear tests conducted at the Nevada Test Site Idaho was one of several states that received the brunt of nuclear fallout from tests at the Nevada Test Site during the 1950s and 1960s . Reports published by the U.S. government indicate that many Idaho citizens perished and continue to suffer as a result of these tests . As of September 2007 , there were continuing efforts in the U.S. congress to compensate victims .

25	26	, following Parton 's decision to pursue a solo career . Parton 's version of `` I Will Always Love You '' was a commercial success . It reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart twice . It first reached number one in June 1974 , and then in October 1982 , with her re-recording on the soundtrack of the movie version of The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas . Thus , she achieved the number one position twice with the same song , a rare feat that Chubby Checker had done previously with `` The Twist '' becoming number one in 1960 and again in 1962 . Whitney Houston recorded her version of the song for the 1992 film The Bodyguard . Her single spent 14 weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart making it one of the best - selling singles of all time . It also holds the record for being the best - selling single by a woman in music history . Houston 's version of `` I Will Always Love You '' re-entered the charts in 2012 after her death , making it the second single ever to reach the top three on the Billboard Hot 100 in separate chart runs . The song has been recorded by many other significant artists including Linda Ronstadt and John Doe .

Problems playing this file ? See media help . A-side label of the original 1974 45 rpm release Country music singer - songwriter Dolly Parton wrote the song in 1973 for her one - time partner and mentor Porter Wagoner , from whom she was separating professionally after a seven - year partnership . She recorded it in RCA 's Studio B in Nashville on June 13 , 1973 . `` I Will Always Love You '' was issued on June 6 , 1974 , as the second single from Parton 's thirteenth solo studio album , Jolene ( 1974 ) . In 1982 , Parton re-recorded the song , when it was included on the soundtrack to the film The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas . In addition to the 1982 re-recording for the soundtrack album , Parton 's original 1974 recording of the song also appeared in Martin Scorsese 's	I Will Always Love You
27	28	film Alice Does n't Live Here Anymore , and the 1996 film It 's My Party . The song also won Parton Female Vocalist of the Year at the 1975 CMA Awards . Author Curtis W. Ellison stated that the song `` speaks about the breakup of a relationship between a man and a woman that does not descend into unremitting domestic turmoil , but instead envisions parting with respect -- because of the initiative of the woman '' . According to sheet music published at musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation , the country love track is set in a time signature of common time with a tempo of 66 beats per minute . ( Larghetto / Adagio ) Although Parton found much success with the song , many people are unaware of its origin ; during an interview , Parton 's manager Danny Nozel said that `` one thing we found out from American Idol is that most people do n't know that Dolly Parton wrote ( the track ) '' . Several times ( long before Whitney Houston recorded the song ) , Dolly Parton asked singer Patti Labelle to record `` I Will Always Love You '' because she felt Patti could have sung it so well . However , Patti admitted she kept putting off the opportunity to do so and later deeply regretted it after she heard Whitney Houston 's wonderful rendition . Reception ( edit ) During its original release in 1974 , ``	I Will Always Love You
28	29	I Will Always Love You '' reached number four in Canada on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart , becoming one of the best selling singles of 1974 . When Parton re-recorded the song in 1982 for the soundtrack of the film The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas , the track was issued as a single and once again charted at number one on Hot Country Songs -- making her the first artist ever to earn a number one record twice with the same song . After recording a duet with Vince Gill in 1995 for the album Something Special , `` I Will Always Love You '' re-entered the Billboard chart and peaked at number 15 . Another duet version of the song was released in 2017 with Michael Bolton from his album Songs of Cinema . When the 1974 recording of the song was reaching number one on the country charts , Elvis Presley indicated that he wanted to cover the song . Parton was interested until Presley 's manager , Colonel Tom Parker , told her that it was standard procedure for the songwriter to sign over half of the publishing rights to any song Elvis recorded . Parton refused . She recalls : I said , ' I 'm really sorry , ' and I cried all night . I mean , it was like the worst thing . You know , it 's	I Will Always Love You
29	30	like , Oh , my God ... Elvis Presley . ' And other people were saying , ' You 're nuts . It 's Elvis Presley . ' ... I said , ' I ca n't do that . Something in my heart says , ' Do n't do that . And I just did n't do it ... He would have killed it . But anyway , so he did n't . Then when Whitney ( Houston 's version ) came out , I made enough money to buy Graceland . Critical reception ( edit ) In Curtis W. Ellison 's book , Country Music Culture : From Hard Times to Heaven ( 1995 ) , he stated : `` In the early 1990s , when ambiguity in romantic relationships accompanies changing expectations for both men and women , this song demonstrates Dolly Parton 's appeal as a songwriter in the pop music market . '' Ken Knight , author of The Midnight Show : Late Night Cable - TV `` Guy - Flicks '' of the ' 80s ( 2008 ) , commented that Parton is the only singer who can sing `` I Will Always Love You '' and `` make it memorable '' . Writer Paul Simpson criticized the singer , stating that the track was only written to `` soften the blow '' of Parton and Wagoner 's split .

See media help . Background ( edit ) In 1992 , R&B singer Whitney Houston recorded a new arrangement of `` I Will Always Love You '' for the soundtrack to The Bodyguard , her film debut . The song has a saxophone solo by Kirk Whalum . She was originally to record Jimmy Ruffin 's `` What Becomes of the Brokenhearted '' as the lead single from The Bodyguard . However , when it was discovered the song was to be used for Fried Green Tomatoes , Houston requested a different song . It was her co-star Kevin Costner who suggested `` I Will Always Love You '' , playing her Linda Ronstadt 's 1975 version from her album Prisoner in Disguise . Producer David Foster re-arranged the song as a	I Will Always Love You
32	33	soul ballad . Her record company did not feel a song with an a cappella introduction would be as successful ; however , Houston and Costner insisted on retaining it . When Parton heard that Houston was using Ronstadt 's recording as a template , she called Foster to give him the final verse , which was missing from the Ronstadt recording , as she felt it was important to the song . The tenor saxophone solo was played by Kirk Whalum . Whitney Houston 's recording is not the only version of the song featured in the movie . In a scene where she dances with Kevin Costner , a version by John Doe can be heard playing on a jukebox . Houston 's version appears at No. 9 on NME 's Greatest No 1 Singles in History list . In 2004 , Houston 's version of `` I Will Always Love You '' finished at # 65 on AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema . It was also ranked at number 22 on The Guardian 's list of Britain 's favorite 100 songs , published in May 2002 . In February 2014 , the song was placed at number six on Billboard 's list of the Top 50 ' Love ' Songs of All Time . A live performance was included on the 1999 release Divas Live ' 99 , and on the 2014 CD / DVD release of Whitney	I Will Always Love You
33	34	Houston Live : Her Greatest Performances , a 1994 performance of the song was included as well . Reception ( edit ) Chart performance ( edit ) The single spent 14 weeks at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 , which at the time was a record . It became Houston 's longest run at number one , surpassing her previous record of three weeks with the `` Greatest Love of All '' in 1986 . It is also the longest running number one single from a soundtrack album . It debuted at number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 , and became Houston 's tenth number one entry two weeks later . It also dominated other Billboard charts , spending 14 weeks at the top of Billboard Hot 100 Single Sales chart , and 11 weeks at number one on its Hot 100 Airplay chart . The song also remained at number one for five weeks on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks , and for 11 weeks on the Hot R&B Singles chart becoming the longest running number one on the R&B charts at the time ; it remained in the top 40 for 24 weeks . It became Arista Records ' biggest hit . The song was number one on the Hot 100 , Adult Contemporary , and R&B chart simultaneously for a record - equaling five weeks ; Ray Charles ' `` I Ca n't Stop Loving You '' in 1962 achieved the same feat	I Will Always Love You
34	35	on the same charts . The song stayed at number one in the United States throughout January and February 1993 , making it the first time Billboard did not rank a new number one single until March of the new year . Houston 's `` I Will Always Love You '' was also the year - end single of 1993 in the US . Similarly , in the UK , Houston 's version was ranked the number one single of 1992 , and then made the countdown again in 1993 where it was ranked number nine , marking the first time any artist or group had the same single ranked in the top 10 of the year - end review two years in a row . In Australia , it was the number 17 single of 1992 and the number two song of 1993 . Houston 's single was also an international success , peaking at number one of the singles charts in almost all countries , including the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles , where it spent 13 weeks at the top . The single ruled the summit position for ten weeks in Australia , five weeks in Austria , seven weeks for Belgium , eight weeks in France , six weeks in Germany , eight weeks in Ireland , two weeks in Italy , six weeks in Netherlands , 11 weeks in New Zealand , nine weeks in Norway , one week in Spain , six weeks in Sweden	I Will Always Love You
35	36	, eight weeks in Switzerland , and ten weeks in the United Kingdom . Houston 's 10 - week reign in the UK set the record for the longest run at the top by a solo female artist in the history of the British singles chart . It is the only single to have topped the United States , the United Kingdom , and Australian singles charts for at least ten weeks . Only a few hours after Houston 's death on February 11 , 2012 , `` I Will Always Love You '' topped the US iTunes charts . Also , in the week following her death , the single returned to the Billboard Hot 100 after almost 20 years , debuting at number 7 , and becoming a posthumous top - ten single for Houston , the first one since 2001 . The song eventually peaked at No. 3 , two spots shy of becoming the first song to return to the No. 1 position after falling off the chart since `` The Twist '' by Chubby Checker . It debuted on the Billboard Hot Digital Singles Chart at number 3 on the chart dated February 25 , 2012 , with over 195,000 copies downloaded . In the United Kingdom , the song charted at number 10 the week of Houston 's death . Houston 's single sold approximately 400,000 copies in its second week at the top of the charts , making it the best - selling	I Will Always Love You
36	37	song in a single week surpassing Bryan Adams ' `` ( Everything I Do ) I Do It for You '' . It broke its own record in the following three weeks , peaking at 632,000 copies in the week ending December 27 , 1992 . The January 9 , 1993 issue of Billboard reported it had broken its own record for most copies sold in a single week for any song in the Nielsen SoundsScan era . This record was broken by Elton John 's `` Candle in the Wind 1997 / Something About the Way You Look Tonight '' , which sold 3.4 million in the final week of September 1997 . `` I Will Always Love You '' was certified four times Platinum in the US for shipments of over 4 million copies by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) on January 12 , 1993 , making Houston the first female artist with a single to reach that level in RIAA history . According to Nielsen SoundScan , as of 2009 , the single had sold 4,591,000 copies , and had become the second best - selling physical single in US alone , only behind Elton John 's single in 1997 . In the United Kingdom , the single sold over 1,550,000 copies , becoming the tenth best - selling single of the 1990s , and was certified two times Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) on January 1 , 1993	I Will Always Love You
37	38	. It was certified Platinum for shipments of over 500,000 copies by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie ( BVMI ) in Germany . In Japan , `` I Will Always Love You '' sold over 810,000 copies , staying for 27 weeks on the chart , and became the best - selling single by a foreign female artist at the time , despite not topping the charts . Critical reception ( edit ) Houston 's version was later called her `` signature song '' . Stephen Holden of The New York Times said it was a `` magnificent rendition '' , commenting Houston transforms a plaintive country ballad into a towering pop - gospel assertion of lasting devotion to a departing lover . Her voice breaking and tensing , she treats the song as a series of emotional bursts in a steady climb toward a final full - out declamation . Along the way , her virtuosic gospel embellishments enhance the emotion and never seem merely ornamental . Writing for USA Today on November 17 , 1992 , James T. Jones IV called it a `` tour - de-force '' , and added `` ( Houston ) gives a 3 ​ ⁄ - star ( out of four ) performance . Where Dolly Parton 's original ' I Will Always Love You ' was plaintive and tear - stained , Houston 's is gospel - infused and dramatic . '' Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times stated : `` Houston has	I Will Always Love You
38	39	the goods to deliver on the tune 's haunting beauty and resists overpowering it -- until the finale , when the key change and stratospheric notes drain all the heart - rending sadness out of the song and make it sound like just another anthem of survival . '' Amy Linden of Entertainment Weekly wrote Houston 's version `` is artistically satisfying and uncharacteristically hip for the MOR songbird . '' Stewart Mason of AllMusic found Houston 's cover `` repulsively overwrought ... so boomingly bombastic and glutinous with self - approbation that the tenderness of Dolly Parton 's song is lost in the mire '' . Accolades ( edit ) `` I Will Always Love You '' won the 1994 Grammy Award for Record of the Year , and Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance , her third award for this category after earlier awards in 1986 and 1988 . During the Grammy Award telecast , the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance , Female was presented to Houston by composer Dolly Parton and David Foster . The single topped the 1993 Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B Singles year - end charts simultaneously , becoming the first single by a female artist and the second overall to achieve that feat behind Prince 's `` When Doves Cry '' in 1984 . In addition , it received Favorite Pop / Rock Single and Favorite Soul / R&B Single awards at the 21st American Music Awards ,	I Will Always Love You
39	40	which was the first record by a solo female artist to win both categories , and the third overall in AMA history behind `` Endless Love '' by Lionel Richie & Diana Ross in 1982 and `` Beat It '' by Michael Jackson in 1984 . `` I Will Always Love You '' won two Japan Gold Disc Awards in 1993 for International Song of the Year , and a 1994 International Song of the Year Special Award for Japanese sales of over one million units . In 2015 , `` I Will Always Love You '' was named the # 1 Song of the Rock Era in the book The Top 500 Songs of the Rock Era : 1955 - 2015 .

However , both Parton and Houston dispelled any rumors , speaking glowingly of one another in interviews . Houston praised Parton for writing a beautiful song . In return , Parton thanked Houston for bringing her song to a wider audience and increasing the amount of royalties for her song in the process . Dolly Parton also gave a live interview , confirming this . When Houston won the Record of the Year award at the 1994 Grammy Awards for the recording , Parton ( along with David Foster ) presented her with the award . In a statement to Billboard on the day of Houston 's death in February 2012 , Parton said : Mine is only one of the millions of hearts broken	I Will Always Love You
41	42	over the death of Whitney Houston . I will always be grateful and in awe of the wonderful performance she did on my song and I can truly say from the bottom of my heart , ' Whitney , I will always love you . You will be missed . ' Music video ( edit ) The single 's music video , is credited to Alan Smithee ( Nick Brandt removed his name due to the way Clive Davis re-edited the video ) , and produced by Rob Newman . It begins with the performance of the song Houston gives at the end of The Bodyguard . The video then cuts to Houston in a dark blue suit sitting in an empty theater with the spotlight shining on her , singing of her love , and at the end of the video , Houston 's theater changes into open camp circled by snow . The video is inter-cut with scenes from The Bodyguard and gives the viewer the experience of reliving the moments with the singer . At the time of the video 's shooting Houston was pregnant with her daughter Bobbi Kristina so is shown only sitting in the theater scenes .

Jennifer Hudson performed the song in front of Houston , who received The BET Honors Award for Entertainer Lifetime Achievement spanning over 25 years in the industry . The 2010 BET Honors Awards was held at the Warner Theatre in Washington , D.C. and aired on February 1 , 2010 . On February 12 , 2012 , Hudson performed the song as a tribute during the 54th Grammy Awards , the day after Houston 's death , alongside images of musicians who had died in 2011 and 2012 , including Amy Winehouse and Etta James . The song was played at Houston 's funeral as her casket was brought out of the church . Parton complimented Hudson on her performance , saying , I was brought to tears again last night , as I 'm sure many were , when Jennifer Hudson sang `` I Will Always Love You '' on the Grammys in memory of Whitney . Like everybody else , I am still in shock . But I know that Whitney will live forever in all the great music that she left behind . I will always have a	I Will Always Love You
47	48	very special piece of her in the song we shared together and had the good fortune to share with the world . Rest in peace , Whitney . Again , we will always love you . In 2012 , following Whitney Houston 's death , American singer Beyoncé performed a tribute to Houston during her revue Revel Presents : Beyoncé Live in Atlantic City , New Jersey at the Revel resort . She began the performance of her song `` Halo '' singing the first verse of `` I Will Always Love You '' a cappella . Later , in 2013 , during her The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour , Beyoncé also sang the opening lines of `` I Will Always Love You '' prior to the performance of `` Halo '' as the final song of the tour . At the 2017 Commencement of the University of Southern California , Will Ferrell sang `` I Will Always Love You '' to the graduating class .

( October 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) A Do & Co à la carte meal as served aboard Austrian Airlines flights An airline meal , airline food , plane food or in - flight meal is a meal served to passengers on board a commercial airliner . These meals are prepared by specialist airline catering services and normally served to passengers using an airline service trolley . These meals vary widely in quality and quantity across different airline companies and classes of travel . They range from a simple snack or beverage in short - haul economy class to a seven - course gourmet meal in a first class long - haul flight . When ticket prices were regulated in the American domestic market , food was the primary means airlines differentiated themselves .

Passengers	Airline meal
121	122	could choose from a selection of sandwiches and fruit . Contents ( edit ) Turkish Airlines Business class meal on an Istanbul to Cairo flight A United Airlines international economy meal . The type of food varies depending upon the airline company and class of travel . Meals may be served on one tray or in multiple courses with no tray and with a tablecloth , metal cutlery , and glassware ( generally in first and business classes ) . Often the food is reflective of the culture of the country the airline is based in . The airline dinner typically includes meat ( most commonly chicken or beef ) , fish , or pasta ; a salad or vegetable ; a small bread roll ; and a dessert . Condiments ( typically salt , pepper , and sugar ) are supplied in small sachets or shakers . Caterers usually produce alternative meals for passengers with restrictive diets . These must usually be ordered in advance , sometimes when buying the ticket . Some of the more common examples include : Cultural diets , such as Turkish , French , Italian , Chinese , Korean , Japanese or Indian style . Infant and baby meals . Some airlines also offer children 's meals , containing foods that children will enjoy such as baked beans , mini-hamburgers and hot dogs . Medical diets , including low / high fiber , low fat / cholesterol , diabetic , peanut free , non-lactose	Airline meal
122	123	, low salt / sodium , low - purine , low - calorie , low - protein , bland ( non-spicy ) and gluten - free meals . Religious diets , including kosher , halal , and Hindu , Buddhist and Jain vegetarian ( sometimes termed Asian vegetarian ) meals . Vegetarian and vegan meals . Some airlines do not offer a specific meal for non-vegan vegetarians ; instead , they are given a vegan meal . Halal food ( edit ) For several Islamic airlines ( e.g. EgyptAir , Emirates , Etihad Airways , Garuda Indonesia , Batik Air , Malindo Air , Gulf Air , Iran Air , Mahan Air , Iran Aseman Airlines , Oman Air , Yemenia , Kuwait Airways , Iraqi Airways , Qatar Airways , Saudia , Biman Bangladesh Airlines , Malaysia Airlines , Royal Brunei Airlines , Royal Air Maroc , Libyan Airlines , Afriqiyah Airways , Tunisair , Air Algérie and Turkish Airlines ) , in accordance with Islamic customs , all classes and dishes on the plane are served a Muslim meal with Halal certification -- without pork and alcohol . While Emirates , Etihad , and Qatar are still providing bottles of wine to non-Muslim passengers , the cabin crew does not deliver alcoholic beverages lest to violate Islamic customs , unless those non-Muslim passengers request it . Because Iran and Saudi Arabia apply strict Sharia regulations , those countries ' airlines do not deliver pork or alcoholic beverages ,	Airline meal
123	124	and all airlines flying to or from Iran or Saudi Arabia are prohibited from serving either . However , Garuda Indonesia is still serving alcoholic beverages ( whiskey , beer , champagne and wine ) to non-Muslim passengers . Kosher food ( edit ) Inflight kosher meal approved by the Beth din of Johannesburg In the case the Israeli airlines El Al , Arkia and Israir , all meals served are kosher - certified by Rabbis . Even destinations outside Israel , sky chefs must be supervised by rabbis to make kosher meals and load their planes . Cutlery and tableware ( edit ) Before the September 11 attacks in 2001 , first class passengers were often provided with full sets of metal cutlery . Afterward , common household items were evaluated more closely for their potential use as weapons on aircraft , and both first class and coach class passengers were restricted to plastic utensils . Some airlines switched from metal to all - plastic or plastic - handled cutlery during the SARS outbreak in 2003 , since the SARS virus transfers from person to person easily , and plastic cutlery can be thrown away after use . Many airlines later switched back to metal cutlery . However , Singapore Airlines continue to use metal utensils even in economy class as of 2017 . In May 2010 , concerns were raised in Australia and New Zealand over their respective flag carriers , Qantas and Air New Zealand , reusing	Airline meal
124	125	their plastic cutlery for international flights between 10 and 30 times before replacement . Both airlines cited cost saving , international quarantine , and environmental as the reasons for the choice . Both have also said that the plastic cutlery is commercially washed and sterilized before reuse . Reusing plastic tablewares though is a regular practice among many airliners and food caterers . For cleanliness , most meals come with a napkin and a moist towelette . First and business class passengers are often provided with hot towels . Breakfast ( edit ) Breakfast served on a short - haul Aeroflot flight During morning flights a cooked breakfast or smaller continental - style may be served . On long haul flights ( and short / medium haul flights within Asia ) breakfast normally includes an entrée of pancakes or eggs , traditional fried breakfast foods such as sausages and grilled tomatoes , and often muffins or pastries , fruits and breakfast cereal on the side . On shorter flights a continental - style breakfast , generally including a miniature box of breakfast cereal , fruits and either a muffin , pastry , or bagel . Coffee and tea are offered as well , and sometimes hot chocolate . Cost ( edit ) In - flight meal on India 's SpiceJet , a low cost airline Food on board a flight is usually free on full - service Asian airlines and on almost all long - distance flights , while they	Airline meal
125	126	might cost extra on low - cost airlines or European full - service airline flights . Quality may also fluctuate due to shifts in the economics of the airline industry . On long - haul international flights in first class and business class , most Asian and European airlines serve gourmet meals , while legacy carriers based in the US tend to serve multicourse meals including a cocktail snack , appetizer , soup , salad , entrée ( chicken , beef , fish , or pasta ) , cheeses with fruit , and ice cream . Some long - haul flights in first and business class offer such delicacies as caviar , champagne , and sorbet ( intermezzo ) . The cost and availability of meals on US airlines has changed considerably in recent years , as financial pressures have forced some airlines to either begin charging for meals , or abandon them altogether in favor of small snacks , as in the case of Southwest Airlines . Eliminating free pretzels saved Northwest $2 million annually . Nowadays , the main US legacy carriers ( American , Delta and United ) have discontinued full meal service in economy class on short - haul US domestic and North American flights , while retaining it on most intercontinental routes ; and at least one European carrier , Icelandair , follows this policy on intercontinental runs as well . As of 2016 , all 4 major U.S. legacy airlines now offer free snacks	Airline meal
126	127	on board in economy class . United Airlines re-introduced free snacks in February 2016 . Starting in April 2016 , American Airlines will fully restore free snacks on all domestic flights in economy class . Free meals will also be available on certain domestic routes . Delta and Southwest have already been offering free snacks for years . Hawaiian Airlines is the only remaining major US airline that offers complimentary in -- flight meals on its domestic flights . Air China has reported that each domestic flight 's meal requires RMB 50 ( US $7.30 ) while international flights require RMB70 ( US $10 ) . However , this figure varies from airline to airline , as some have reported costs to be as low as US $3.50 . Air China is also minimizing costs by loading only 95 % of all meals to reduce leftovers and storing non-perishable foods for emergencies . In 1958 Pan Am and several European airlines entered into a legal dispute over whether certain airline food sandwiches counted as a `` meal '' . Preparation ( edit ) Food being delivered to a Boeing 767 Meals must generally be prepared on the ground before takeoff . Guillaume de Syon , a history professor at Albright College who wrote about the history of airline meals , said that the higher altitudes alter the taste of the food and the function of the taste buds ( although that 's not case on Dreamliner or A350 ) ;	Airline meal
127	128	according to de Syon the food may taste `` dry and flavorless '' as a result of the pressurization and passengers , feeling thirsty due to pressurization , many drink alcohol when they ought to drink water . Tests have shown that the perception of saltiness and sweetness drops 30 % at high altitudes . The low humidity in airline cabins also dries out the nose which decreases olfactory sensors which are essential for tasting flavor in dishes . Food safety is paramount in the airline catering industry . A case of mass food poisoning amongst the passengers on an airliner could have disastrous consequences . For example , on February 20 , 1992 , shrimp tainted with cholera was served on Aerolíneas Argentinas Flight 386 . An elderly passenger died and other passengers fell ill . For this reason catering firms and airlines have worked together to provide a set of industry guidelines specific to the needs of airline catering . The World Food Safety Guidelines for Airline Catering is offered free of charge by the International Flight Service Association .

It was begun in 1296 in the Gothic style to a design of Arnolfo di Cambio and was structurally completed by 1436 , with the dome designed by Filippo Brunelleschi . The exterior of the basilica is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green and pink , bordered by white , and has an elaborate 19th - century Gothic Revival façade by Emilio De Fabris . The cathedral complex , in Piazza del Duomo , includes the Baptistery and Giotto 's Campanile . These three buildings are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site covering the historic centre of Florence and are a major tourist attraction of Tuscany . The basilica is one of Italy 's largest churches , and until the development of new structural materials in the modern era , the dome was the largest in the world . It remains the largest brick dome ever constructed .	Florence Cathedral

The ancient structure , founded in the early 5th century and having undergone many repairs , was crumbling with age , according to the 14th - century Nuova Cronica of Giovanni Villani , and was no longer large enough to serve the growing population of the city . Other major Tuscan cities had undertaken ambitious reconstructions of their cathedrals during the Late Medieval period , such as Pisa and particularly Siena where the enormous proposed extensions were never completed . Giotto 's bell tower ( campanile ) The new church was designed by Arnolfo di Cambio and approved by city council in 1294 . Di Cambio was also architect of the church of Santa Croce and the Palazzo Vecchio . He designed three wide naves ending under the octagonal dome , with the middle nave	Florence Cathedral
137	138	covering the area of Santa Reparata . The first stone was laid on September 9 , 1296 , by Cardinal Valeriana , the first papal legate ever sent to Florence . The building of this vast project was to last 140 years ; Arnolfo 's plan for the eastern end , although maintained in concept , was greatly expanded in size . The Duomo , as if completed , in a fresco by Andrea di Bonaiuto , painted in the 1360s , before the commencement of the dome After Arnolfo died in 1310 , work on the cathedral slowed for thirty years . When the relics of Saint Zenobius were discovered in 1330 in Santa Reparata , the project gained a new impetus . In 1331 , the Arte della Lana , the guild of wool merchants , took over patronage for the construction of the cathedral and in 1334 appointed Giotto to oversee the work . Assisted by Andrea Pisano , Giotto continued di Cambio 's design . His major accomplishment was the building of the campanile . When Giotto died the January 8th of 1337 , Andrea Pisano continued the building until work was halted due to the Black Death in 1348 . In 1349 , work resumed on the cathedral under a series of architects , starting with Francesco Talenti , who finished the campanile and enlarged the overall project to include the apse and the side chapels . In 1359 , Talenti was succeeded by Giovanni	Florence Cathedral
138	139	di Lapo Ghini ( 1360 -- 1369 ) who divided the center nave in four square bays . Other architects were Alberto Arnoldi , Giovanni d'Ambrogio , Neri di Fioravante and Andrea Orcagna . By 1375 , the old church Santa Reparata was pulled down . The nave was finished by 1380 , and by 1418 , only the dome remained incomplete . Procession outside the cathedral during the 18th century On 18 August 1418 , the Arte della Lana announced an architectural design competition for erecting Neri 's dome . The two main competitors were two master goldsmiths , Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi , the latter of whom was supported by Cosimo de Medici . Ghiberti had been the winner of a competition for a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistery in 1401 and lifelong competition between the two remained sharp . Brunelleschi won and received the commission . Ghiberti , appointed coadjutator , drew a salary equal to Brunelleschi 's and , though neither was awarded the announced prize of 200 florins , was promised equal credit , although he spent most of his time on other projects . When Brunelleschi became ill , or feigned illness , the project was briefly in the hands of Ghiberti . But Ghiberti soon had to admit that the whole project was beyond him . In 1423 , Brunelleschi was back in charge and took over sole responsibility . Work started on the dome in 1420 and was completed	Florence Cathedral
139	140	in 1436 . The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Eugene IV on March 25 , 1436 , ( the first day of the year according to the Florentine calendar ) . It was the first ' octagonal ' dome in history to be built without a temporary wooden supporting frame . It was one of the most impressive projects of the Renaissance . During the consecration in 1436 , Guillaume Dufay 's motet Nuper rosarum flores was performed . The structure of this motet was strongly influenced by the structure of the dome . The Duomo and Baptistery of St. John from Piazza del Duomo The decoration of the exterior of the cathedral , begun in the 14th century , was not completed until 1887 , when the polychrome marble façade was completed with the design of Emilio De Fabris . The floor of the church was relaid in marble tiles in the 16th century . The exterior walls are faced in alternate vertical and horizontal bands of polychrome marble from Carrara ( white ) , Prato ( green ) , Siena ( red ) , Lavenza and a few other places . These marble bands had to repeat the already existing bands on the walls of the earlier adjacent baptistery the Battistero di San Giovanni and Giotto 's Bell Tower . There are two side doors : the Doors of the Canonici ( south side ) and the Door of the Mandorla ( north side ) with sculptures by	Florence Cathedral
140	141	Nanni di Banco , Donatello , and Jacopo della Quercia . The six side windows , notable for their delicate tracery and ornaments , are separated by pilasters . Only the four windows closest to the transept admit light ; the other two are merely ornamental . The clerestory windows are round , a common feature in Italian Gothic . During its long history , this cathedral has been the seat of the Council of Florence ( 1439 ) , heard the preachings of Girolamo Savonarola and witnessed the murder of Giuliano di Piero de ' Medici on Sunday , 26 April 1478 ( with Lorenzo Il Magnifico barely escaping death ) , in the Pazzi conspiracy . Exterior ( edit ) Plan and structure ( edit ) Plan of the church with various extension phases The cathedral of Florence is built as a basilica , having a wide central nave of four square bays , with an aisle on either side . The chancel and transepts are of identical polygonal plan , separated by two smaller polygonal chapels . The whole plan forms a Latin cross . The nave and aisles are separated by wide pointed Gothic arches resting on composite piers . The dimensions of the building are enormous : building area 8,300 square metres ( 89,340 square feet ) , length 153 metres ( 502 feet ) , width 38 metres ( 125 feet ) , width at the crossing 90 metres ( 300 feet ) .	Florence Cathedral
141	142	The height of the arches in the aisles is 23 metres ( 75 feet ) . The height of the dome is 114.5 metres ( 375.7 feet ) . Dome ( edit ) By the beginning of the 15th century , after a hundred years of construction , the structure was still missing its dome . The basic features of the dome had been designed by Arnolfo di Cambio in 1296 . His brick model , 4.6 metres ( 15.1 ft ) high , 9.2 metres ( 30.2 feet ) long , was standing in a side aisle of the unfinished building , and had long been sacrosanct . It called for an octagonal dome higher and wider than any that had ever been built , with no external buttresses to keep it from spreading and falling under its own weight . External video Smarthistory -- Brunelleschi 's Dome The commitment to reject traditional Gothic buttresses had been made when Neri di Fioravanti 's model was chosen over a competing one by Giovanni di Lapo Ghini . That architectural choice , in 1367 , was one of the first events of the Italian Renaissance , marking a break with the Medieval Gothic style and a return to the classic Mediterranean dome . Italian architects regarded Gothic flying buttresses as ugly makeshifts . Furthermore , the use of buttresses was forbidden in Florence , as the style was favored by central Italy 's traditional enemies to the north . Neri 's	Florence Cathedral
142	143	model depicted a massive inner dome , open at the top to admit light , like Rome 's Pantheon , but enclosed in a thinner outer shell , partly supported by the inner dome , to keep out the weather . It was to stand on an unbuttressed octagonal drum . Neri 's dome would need an internal defense against spreading ( hoop stress ) , but none had yet been designed . Dome seen from the Giotto 's Campanile The building of such a masonry dome posed many technical problems . Brunelleschi looked to the great dome of the Pantheon in Rome for solutions . The dome of the Pantheon is a single shell of concrete , the formula for which had long since been forgotten . The Pantheon had employed structural centring to support the concrete dome while it cured . This could not be the solution in the case of a dome this size and would put the church out of use . For the height and breadth of the dome designed by Neri , starting 52 metres ( 171 ft ) above the floor and spanning 44 meters ( 144 ft ) , there was not enough timber in Tuscany to build the scaffolding and forms . Brunelleschi chose to follow such design and employed a double shell , made of sandstone and marble . Brunelleschi would have to build the dome out of brick , due to its light weight compared to stone and being	Florence Cathedral
143	144	easier to form , and with nothing under it during construction . To illustrate his proposed structural plan , he constructed a wooden and brick model with the help of Donatello and Nanni di Banco , a model which is still displayed in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo . The model served as a guide for the craftsmen , but was intentionally incomplete , so as to ensure Brunelleschi 's control over the construction . Interior of the dome Brunelleschi 's solutions were ingenious , such as his use of the catenary arch for support . The spreading problem was solved by a set of four internal horizontal stone and iron chains , serving as barrel hoops , embedded within the inner dome : one at the top , one at the bottom , with the remaining two evenly spaced between them . A fifth chain , made of wood , was placed between the first and second of the stone chains . Since the dome was octagonal rather than round , a simple chain , squeezing the dome like a barrel hoop , would have put all its pressure on the eight corners of the dome . The chains needed to be rigid octagons , stiff enough to hold their shape , so as not to deform the dome as they held it together . The Duomo viewed from the heights of Piazzale Michelangelo Each of Brunelleschi 's stone chains was built like an octagonal railroad track with parallel	Florence Cathedral
144	145	rails and cross ties , all made of sandstone beams 43 centimetres ( 17 in ) in diameter and no more than 2.3 metres ( 7.5 ft ) long . The rails were connected end - to - end with lead - glazed iron splices . The cross ties and rails were notched together and then covered with the bricks and mortar of the inner dome . The cross ties of the bottom chain can be seen protruding from the drum at the base of the dome . The others are hidden . Each stone chain was supposed to be reinforced with a standard iron chain made of interlocking links , but a magnetic survey conducted in the 1970s failed to detect any evidence of iron chains , which if they exist are deeply embedded in the thick masonry walls . Brunelleschi also included vertical `` ribs '' set on the corners of the octagon , curving towards the center point . The Ribs , 13 feet ( 4 meters ) deep , are supported by 16 concealed ribs radiating from center . The ribs had slits to take beams that supported platforms , thus allowing the work to progress upward without the need for scaffolding . A circular masonry dome can be built without supports , called centering , because each course of bricks is a horizontal arch that resists compression . In Florence , the octagonal inner dome was thick enough for an imaginary circle to be embedded	Florence Cathedral
145	146	in it at each level , a feature that would hold the dome up eventually , but could not hold the bricks in place while the mortar was still wet . Brunelleschi used a herringbone brick pattern to transfer the weight of the freshly laid bricks to the nearest vertical ribs of the non-circular dome . Baptistery of St. John next to the cathedral The outer dome was not thick enough to contain embedded horizontal circles , being only 60 centimetres ( 2 ft ) thick at the base and 30 centimetres ( 1 ft ) thick at the top . To create such circles , Brunelleschi thickened the outer dome at the inside of its corners at nine different elevations , creating nine masonry rings , which can be observed today from the space between the two domes . To counteract hoop stress , the outer dome relies entirely on its attachment to the inner dome and has no embedded chains . A modern understanding of physical laws and the mathematical tools for calculating stresses were centuries in the future . Brunelleschi , like all cathedral builders , had to rely on intuition and whatever he could learn from the large scale models he built . To lift 37,000 tons of material , including over 4 million bricks , he invented hoisting machines and lewissons for hoisting large stones . These specially designed machines and his structural innovations were Brunelleschi 's chief contribution to architecture . Although he was	Florence Cathedral
146	147	executing an aesthetic plan made half a century earlier , it is his name , rather than Neri 's , that is commonly associated with the dome . Brunelleschi 's ability to crown the dome with a lantern was questioned and he had to undergo another competition , even though there had been evidence that Brunelleschi had been working on a design for a lantern for the upper part of the dome . The evidence is shown in the curvature , which was made steeper than the original model . He was declared the winner over his competitors Lorenzo Ghiberti and Antonio Ciaccheri . His design ( now on display in the Museum Opera del Duomo ) was for an octagonal lantern with eight radiating buttresses and eight high arched windows . Construction of the lantern was begun a few months before his death in 1446 . Then , for 15 years , little progress was possible , due to alterations by several architects . The lantern was finally completed by Brunelleschi 's friend Michelozzo in 1461 . The conical roof was crowned with a gilt copper ball and cross , containing holy relics , by Verrocchio in 1469 . This brings the total height of the dome and lantern to 114.5 meters ( 375 ft ) . This copper ball was struck by lightning on 17 July 1600 and fell down . It was replaced by an even larger one two years later . Cupola of the Dome The	Florence Cathedral
147	148	commission for this bronze ball ( atop the lantern ) went to the sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio , in whose workshop there was at this time a young apprentice named Leonardo da Vinci . Fascinated by Filippo 's ( Brunelleschi 's ) machines , which Verrocchio used to hoist the ball , Leonardo made a series of sketches of them and , as a result , is often given credit for their invention . Leonardo might have also participated in the design of the bronze ball , as stated in the G manuscript of Paris `` Remember the way we soldered the ball of Santa Maria del Fiore '' . The decorations of the drum gallery by Baccio d'Agnolo were never finished after being disapproved by no one less than Michelangelo . A huge statue of Brunelleschi now sits outside the Palazzo dei Canonici in the Piazza del Duomo , looking thoughtfully up towards his greatest achievement , the dome that would forever dominate the panorama of Florence . It is still the largest masonry dome in the world . The building of the cathedral had started in 1296 with the design of Arnolfo di Cambio and was completed in 1469 with the placing of Verrochio 's copper ball atop the lantern . But the façade was still unfinished and would remain so until the 19th century . Façade ( edit ) Façade Façade of the cathedral The original façade , designed by Arnolfo di Cambio and usually attributed to	Florence Cathedral
148	149	Giotto , was actually begun twenty years after Giotto 's death . A mid-15th - century pen - and - ink drawing of this so - called Giotto 's façade is visible in the Codex Rustici , and in the drawing of Bernardino Poccetti in 1587 , both on display in the Museum of the Opera del Duomo . This façade was the collective work of several artists , among them Andrea Orcagna and Taddeo Gaddi . This original façade was completed in only its lower portion and then left unfinished . It was dismantled in 1587 -- 1588 by the Medici court architect Bernardo Buontalenti , ordered by Grand Duke Francesco I de ' Medici , as it appeared totally outmoded in Renaissance times . Some of the original sculptures are on display in the Museum Opera del Duomo , behind the cathedral . Others are now in the Berlin Museum and in the Louvre . The competition for a new façade turned into a huge corruption scandal . The wooden model for the façade of Buontalenti is on display in the Museum Opera del Duomo . A few new designs had been proposed in later years , but the models ( of Giovanni Antonio Dosio , Giovanni de ' Medici with Alessandro Pieroni and Giambologna ) were not accepted . The façade was then left bare until the 19th century . Main portal by Augusto Passaglia Statue of Saint Reparata , to whom the previous cathedral was dedicated	Florence Cathedral
149	150	, in the main portal In 1864 , a competition held to design a new façade was won by Emilio De Fabris ( 1808 -- 1883 ) in 1871 . Work began in 1876 and was completed in 1887 . This neo-gothic façade in white , green and red marble forms a harmonious entity with the cathedral , Giotto 's bell tower and the Baptistery , but some think it is excessively decorated . The whole façade is dedicated to the Mother of Christ . Main portal ( edit ) The three huge bronze doors date from 1899 to 1903 . They are adorned with scenes from the life of the Madonna . The mosaics in the lunettes above the doors were designed by Niccolò Barabino . They represent ( from left to right ) : Charity among the founders of Florentine philanthropic institutions ; Christ enthroned with Mary and John the Baptist ; and Florentine artisans , merchants and humanists . The pediment above the central portal contains a half - relief by Tito Sarrocchi of Mary enthroned holding a flowered scepter . Giuseppe Cassioli sculpted the right - hand door . On top of the façade is a series of niches with the twelve Apostles with , in the middle , the Madonna with Child . Between the rose window and the tympanum , there is a gallery with busts of great Florentine artists . Interior ( edit ) This section needs additional citations for verification .

The relative bareness of the church corresponds with the austerity of religious life , as preached by Girolamo Savonarola . Many decorations in the church have been lost in the course of time , or have been transferred to the Museum Opera del Duomo , such as the magnificent cantorial pulpits ( the singing galleries for the choristers ) of Luca della Robbia and Donatello .

Funerary Monument to Sir John Hawkwood by Paolo Uccello ( 1436 ) . This almost monochrome fresco , transferred to canvas in the 19th century , is painted in terra verde , a color closest to the patina of bronze . Equestrian statue of Niccolò da Tolentino by Andrea del Castagno ( 1456 ) .

However , it is more richly decorated and gives more the impression of movement . Both frescoes portray the condottieri as heroic figures riding triumphantly . Both painters had problems when applying in painting the new rules of perspective to foreshortening : they used two unifying points , one for the horse and one for the pedestal , instead a single unifying point . Busts of Giotto ( by Benedetto da Maiano ) , Brunelleschi ( by Buggiano -- 1447 ) , Marsilio Ficino , and Antonio Squarcialupi ( a most famous organist ) .

This one - handed liturgical clock shows the 24 hours of the hora italica ( Italian time ) , a period of time ending with sunset at 24 hours . This timetable was used until the 18th century . This is one of the few clocks from that time that still exist and are in working order . The church is particularly notable for its 44 stained glass windows , the largest undertaking of this kind in Italy in the 14th and 15th century . The windows in the aisles and in the transept depict saints from the Old and the New Testament , while the circular windows in the drum of the dome or above the entrance depict Christ and Mary . They are the work of the greatest Florentine artists of their times , such as Donatello , Lorenzo Ghiberti , Paolo Uccello and Andrea del Castagno . Christ crowning Mary as Queen , the stained - glass circular window above the clock , with a rich range of coloring , was designed by Gaddo Gaddi in the early 14th century . Donatello designed the stained - glass window ( Coronation of the Virgin ) in the drum of the dome ( the only one that can be seen from the nave ) . The beautiful funeral	Florence Cathedral
153	154	monument of Antonio d'Orso ( 1323 ) , bishop of Florence , was made by Tino da Camaino , the most important funeral sculptor of his time . The monumental crucifix , behind the Bishop 's Chair at the high altar , is by Benedetto da Maiano ( 1495 -- 1497 ) . The choir enclosure is the work of the famous Bartolommeo Bandinelli . The ten - paneled bronze doors of the sacristy were made by Luca della Robbia , who has also two glazed terracotta works inside the sacristy : Angel with Candlestick and Resurrection of Christ . In the back of the middle of the three apses is the altar of Saint Zanobius , first bishop of Florence . Its silver shrine , a masterpiece of Ghiberti , contains the urn with his relics . The central compartment shows us one of his miracles , the reviving of a dead child . Above this shrine is the painting Last Supper by the lesser - known Giovanni Balducci . There was also a glass - paste mosaic panel The Bust of Saint Zanobius by the 16th - century miniaturist Monte di Giovanni , but it is now on display in the Museum Opera del Duomo . Many decorations date from the 16th - century patronage of the Grand Dukes , such as the pavement in colored marble , attributed to Baccio d'Agnolo and Francesco da Sangallo ( 1520 -- 26 ) . Some pieces of marble from the	Florence Cathedral
154	155	façade were used , topside down , in the flooring ( as was shown by the restoration of the floor after the 1966 flooding ) . It was suggested that the interior of the 45 metre ( 147 ft ) wide dome should be covered with a mosaic decoration to make the most of the available light coming through the circular windows of the drum and through the lantern . Brunelleschi had proposed the vault to glimmer with resplendent gold , but his death in 1446 put an end to this project , and the walls of the dome were whitewashed . Grand Duke Cosimo I de ' Medici decided to have the dome painted with a representation of The Last Judgment . This enormous work , 3,600 metres2 ( 38 750 ft2 ) of painted surface , was started in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari and would last till 1579 . The upper portion , near the lantern , representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574 . Federico Zuccari and a number of collaborators , such as Domenico Cresti , finished the other portions : ( from top to bottom ) Choirs of Angels ; Christ , Mary and Saints ; Virtues , Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes ; and at the bottom of the cupola : Capital Sins and Hell . These frescoes are considered Zuccari 's greatest work . But the quality of the	Florence Cathedral
155	156	work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques . Vasari had used true fresco , while Zuccari had painted in secco . During the restoration work , which ended in 1995 , the entire pictorial cycle of The Last Judgment was photographed with specially designed equipment and all the information collected in a catalogue . All the restoration information along with reconstructed images of the frescos were stored and managed in the Thesaurus Florentinus computer system . Crypt ( edit ) Tomb of Filippo Brunelleschi . The cathedral underwent difficult excavations between 1965 and 1974 . The archaeological history of this huge area was reconstructed through the work of Dr. Franklin Toker : remains of Roman houses , an early Christian pavement , ruins of the former cathedral of Santa Reparata and successive enlargements of this church . Close to the entrance , in the part of the crypt open to the public , is the tomb of Brunelleschi . While its location is prominent , the actual tomb is simple and humble . That the architect was permitted such a prestigious burial place is proof of the high esteem he was given by the Florentines .

It was released in December 1989 as one of four singles from Myles ' 1989 eponymous album from Atlantic Records . It became a number - one hit for two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in 1990 and reached number one on the Album Rock Tracks chart , as well as number ten in her native Canada and number two on the UK Singles Chart .

Co-writer Christopher Ward , who was Myles ' then - boyfriend , was inspired on a bus full of Elvis fans riding to Memphis attending the 10th anniversary vigil at Graceland , in 1987 . Upon his return to Canada , he brought his idea to Alannah and producer David Tyson , who wrote the chords for the bridge . The song was one of three in a demo Myles presented to Atlantic Records which eventually got her signed to the label . Atlantic Records , much to the disappointment of Myles , for whom the song had been written , gave the song for country artist Robin Lee to record . In the USA , Myles ' version was released in December 1989 , while Lee 's	Black Velvet (song)
166	167	version was released two months later , in February 1990 . This led to Myles being promoted by Atlantic on the pop and rock radio stations , and Lee on the country radio stations . Lee even filmed a videoclip to the song very similar to Myles ' video . Myles released a new version of the song on a digitally released Elvis tribute EP to commemorate the 30 years since his death in August 2007 . It was later included on her 2008 Black Velvet CD . The song is performed in the key of D ♯ minor with a swinging tempo of 91 beats per minute in common time . Myles ' vocals span from C ♯ to D ♯ in the song . Music video ( edit ) The music video , directed by Doug Freel , was partially shot in Myles ' family ranch in Buckhorn , Ontario . Myles is seen singing at a cabin porch with her guitarist , intercut with scenes from Myles in concert with her band . Release and reception ( edit ) Released as the second single of Myles ' debut album , it was first released in her native Canada in July 1989 , peaking at # 10 in September of that year , becoming the first of four top 10 hits for Myles in her homeland .

176	177	Brian Cassidy - wikipedia Brian Cassidy Jump to : navigation , search Brian Cassidy Law & Order character First appearance `` Payback '' ( season 1 ) Last appearance `` Chasing Demons '' ( season 19 ) Portrayed by Dean Winters Time on show 1999 -- 2000 , 2012 -- 2014 , 2017 -- 2018 Seasons 1 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 19 Credited appearances 32 episodes ( total ) Succeeded by Monique Jeffries Information Title NYPD Detective Police Officer ( Season 15 ) DA Investigator ( Season 19 ) Partner John Munch Detective Brian Cassidy is a fictional character played by Dean Winters in the American crime drama television series Law & Order : Special Victims Unit on NBC . A recurring cast member during the first season , Cassidy is a young and inexperienced detective with the New York Police Department 's Special Victims Unit , and the original partner of John Munch ( Richard Belzer ) . The stress of the Special Victims Unit is too much for Cassidy , and he transfers to the Narcotics unit in the middle of the season . Cassidy later returns in the thirteenth season finale working undercover for a pimp the SVU detectives are investigating . Winters had previously worked with creator Dick Wolf , but he was offered a role on SVU through Belzer , though the role proved to be temporary due to Winters 's commitment to Oz . As Winters only remained with the series	Brian Cassidy
177	178	for thirteen episodes , his character never had much of a chance to develop . Winters wanted to return to the show for a long time , though , and felt the time was right during the thirteenth season finale . Critics were generally negative about Cassidy during the character 's initial tenure on the show , but some were glad to see his return in `` Rhodium Nights '' . Contents ( hide ) 1 Character biography 2 Development 3 Awards and decorations 4 Reception 5 References 5.1 Notes 5.2 Bibliography Character biography ( edit ) Though Cassidy is a dedicated member of the Special Victims Unit , he lacks the emotional maturity to deal with sex crimes and the language to describe them . He views his partner , John Munch ( Richard Belzer ) , as a mentor . Cassidy had a drunken one - night stand with fellow SVU Detective Olivia Benson ( Mariska Hargitay ) , and expressed a desire to pursue a relationship . Benson turns him down , however , citing a policy of not having relationships with coworkers . Years later , Benson expresses regret at the way she handled the situation . This and the stress of the unit wear Cassidy down and , after an outburst in the squad room directed at Benson , Captain Donald Cragen ( Dann Florek ) sends Cassidy to check up on a teenage rape victim Cragen encountered when he worked in Homicide . After	Brian Cassidy
178	179	she tells him in detail how she had been systematically violated by her abuser and then gang - raped , Cassidy decides he lacks the stomach to deal with sex crimes , and transfers to the NYPD 's Narcotics Division . Munch later laments that he felt abandoned when Cassidy became the latest in a long line of partners who left him . Cassidy returns in the season 13 episode `` Rhodium Nights '' . He has been working undercover for the past three years as a bodyguard for a pimp , Bart Ganzel ( Peter Jacobson ) , his former colleagues at the SVU are investigating , and provides the detectives with information about Ganzel 's prostitution ring . When a prostitute named Carissa Gibson ( Pippa Black ) , who had been dating both Cassidy and Ganzel , is found dead in bed with Cragen , Detective Nick Amaro ( Danny Pino ) believes Cassidy played a role in framing Cragen despite protests from the other SVU detectives . Amaro confronts Cassidy at gunpoint and tries to force information out of him . Cassidy is later shot by a corrupt NYPD police officer after Ganzel discovers Cassidy is working undercover to expose him , and Amaro helps uncover the conspiracy that led to the attack on Cassidy . Cassidy survives , and awakens in the hospital , where Benson tells him she is not the same person she was thirteen years ago and kisses him . In the	Brian Cassidy
179	180	episode , `` Undercover Blue '' , Cassidy is accused of rape by a prostitute while he was undercover almost four years prior . It is revealed that Cassidy was being set up by the woman and her boss to make money off a lawsuit against the NYPD and the charges are dropped . Also in this episode , Munch says that Cassidy paid the price for having a relationship with a prostitute while undercover with Ganzel , as he was demoted from detective to an officer who works nights at a Bronx courthouse . Benson and Cassidy also are forced to reveal their romantic relationship in this episode when Amaro and Munch go to Cassidy 's apartment and find Benson there . In Season 15 , Cassidy and Benson are still romantically involved and move in together . In the episode `` Internal Affairs '' , Cassidy is put undercover by Internal Affairs Bureau Lt. Ed Tucker ( Robert John Burke ) to investigate a dirty precinct , an assignment that very nearly leads to his death at the hands of two of its officers . Tucker promises that if the operation is successful , he will earn his detective shield back . In the episode , `` Rapist Anonymous '' , it is revealed that he has been given back the title of detective , and will be working in Internal Affairs . Cassidy and Benson amicably break up around the time of the episode `` Downloaded Child	Brian Cassidy
180	181	'' , after realizing that Cassidy prefers to live in the moment , while Benson still plans for the future . At the end of `` Gone Fishin ' '' , he returns as a DA Investigator and tells Benson that he is investigating her for child abuse . In `` Mood '' , it was revealed that he told another DA investigator about Benson and her ordeal with serial rapist William Lewis ( Pablo Schreiber ) , which indirectly led to the child abuse claim . Benson is furious , and says she never wants to speak to him again . In `` Chasing Demons '' , Cassidy testifies against a child molester who he had physically assaulted while placing him under arrest ; Cassidy loses his temper during cross-examination and threatens to kill him , causing a mistrial . The suspect is murdered the following day after Cassidy is seen at his house , and ADA Peter Stone ( Philip Winchester ) has him arrested for murder . However , it is eventually revealed that the killer is one of the suspect 's victims , and Cassidy is exonerated . He tells Stone that one of the reasons he joined SVU was that he had been molested as a child by his Little League coach , and that one of the reasons he left was that he could n't handle the memories coming back . Development ( edit ) `` It 's amazing . I 've wanted to	Brian Cassidy
181	182	come back for a long time but scheduling difficulties never really permitted it , so , with this storyline , with the ( season 13 ) finale and now what we 're doing with the two - hour ( season 14 ) opening movie , it feels like this was the right time to come , so I 'm glad I waited . '' -- Dean Winters , Although Winters previously worked with Dick Wolf on New York Undercover , he credited fellow cast member Richard Belzer with getting him the job on Law & Order : Special Victims Unit . Belzer and Winters had first worked together when Winters guest starred on Homicide : Life on the Street , where Belzer was a regular . Wolf invited Belzer to join the cast of his new Law & Order spin - off after Homicide was cancelled , and Belzer told Wolf he would only join the cast if Winters was his partner on the show . Winters had a role at the same time on the HBO drama Oz and , while the SVU role was initially only supposed to last a few episodes , he was contractually obligated to Oz , and eventually departed SVU completely to focus on Oz . Winters believed that Cassidy was not unintelligent , but simply naive . He voiced early on a desire to executive producer Ted Kotcheff that Cassidy not be made into the `` dumb blonde '' of the unit because	Brian Cassidy
182	183	he did not believe there would be any in the Special Victims Unit . Cassidy 's character did not see much development , but Winters attributed this to the lack of time the character was on the show . His character appeared during the first half of the first season , when the writers were trying to flesh out all of the characters on the show . Had he remained on the show longer , Winters believed that the writers would have found much more for Cassidy to do . Winters was not bitter that the SVU role did not work out , and he wanted to return to the series for many years . During the thirteenth season , SVU was filming scenes in front of the building where Winters lived , so he chatted with the cast and crew , especially his former costar Mariska Hargitay . Hargitay helped Winters return to the show for the season finale that year . Winters saw potential in the storyline involving Donald Cragen ( Dann Florek ) being framed for the murder of a prostitute and believed the time was right , so he agreed to stay on as a recurring character in the fourteenth season . Winters was excited about the changes in Cassidy 's character ; while Cassidy was young and immature in the first season , he had become more grizzled in the years since , and Winters believed the audience was left with suspense in the fourteenth	Brian Cassidy
183	184	season premiere not knowing whether Cassidy was corrupt or not . Awards and decorations ( edit ) The following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Cassidy , as seen in `` Internal Affairs '' . American Flag Breast Bar NYPD Meritorious Police Duty Reception ( edit ) After the premiere of SVU , Variety 's Phil Gallo felt that Cassidy was not given much to do , and what he comes up with is an `` irksome single note '' . Entertainment Weekly 's Bruce Fretts agreed that the audience did not get to see enough of Cassidy . Regarding Cassidy 's return to the show , Brittany Frederick of Star Pulse said , `` It was a pleasant surprise to see Dean Winters reprise his role as Detective Brian Cassidy last season ; his character was with the show so briefly that we did n't really get to know him ... Cassidy is an entirely different person now - as he should be after so many years absent - but there 's an odd comfort in getting to see him again when the show could 've easily come up with a random undercover cop to fill his role .

193	194	Hebrew : הרכבת הקלה בירושלים ‎ , HaRakevet HaKala Birushalayim ) is a light rail system in Jerusalem . Currently , the Red Line is the only one in operation , the first of several light rail lines planned in Jerusalem . Construction on the Red line began in 2002 and ended in 2010 , when the testing phase began . It was built by the CityPass consortium , which has a 30 - year concession to operate it . The project required construction of the Jerusalem Chords Bridge as well as other renovation projects around Jerusalem . After repeated delays due to archaeological discoveries and technical issues , service began , initially free of charge , on August 19 , 2011 . It became fully operational on December 1 , 2011 . The line is 13.9 kilometers ( 8.6 mi ) long with 23 stops . Extensions to the red line are currently under construction to the northern suburb of Neve Yaakov and to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital to the southwest . When completed in 2018 , these will extend the line 's length to 22.5 km . With a total estimated cost for the Red Line 's initial section of ₪ 3.8 billion ( approx . US $1.1 billion ) , the project was criticized for budget overruns , for its route serving Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and for contributing to air and noise pollution during construction . The Green line 's plans have been approved by	Jerusalem Light Rail

The primary roads led to the gates of the Old City , such as the Jaffa Gate and the Damascus Gate . It was along these roads that the city grew when it expanded beyond the walls of the Old City in the 19th century , the major thoroughfares of the city thus becoming the Jaffa Road , leading to the west	Jerusalem Light Rail
195	196	in the direction of the coastal plain , the watershed routes ( Ridge Route ) leading north to Ramallah , Nablus , and Damascus , and south to Bethlehem and Hebron , and one to the east to Jericho . Early plans for an electric tramway were drawn up by a Greek Lebanese engineer , George Franjieh , in 1892 , who had been involved in planning the Jaffa -- Jerusalem railway . The tram would connect the city with Ein Karem and Bethlehem . In 1910 , a tender for a tramway was published by the Ottoman authorities . In 1918 , the British Army built a rail system linking the German Colony with Al - Bireh , on the outskirts of Ramallah , traversing Jerusalem along a winding route . It was built by Rail Builders Company 272 of the British Royal Engineers , commanded by Colonel Jordan Bell , with some 850 Egyptian and local Arab laborers , about half of them women . The railway was used by the British army , and for a few months it supplied Allenby 's troops . It was dismantled shortly after the front moved northward in late 1918 . Some of the city 's streets may have been paved along its route . In the 1970s , when traffic congestion mounted in the city center , proposals were discussed for widening the main roads . In 1996 , the government approved new plans for an integrated network relying on	Jerusalem Light Rail
196	197	rapid transit , including a light rail system and bus rapid transit . Construction ( edit ) In the 1990s , a light rail system was proposed as a means of providing faster and less polluting public transit through the heart of the city , and reversing the decline of certain central areas . CityPass , a specially formed consortium , won a 30 - year concession to build and operate Line 1 ( the `` Red Line '' ) . CityPass consists of financiers Harel ( 20 % ) , Polar Investments ( 17.5 % ) and the Israel Infrastructure Fund ( 10 % ) , constructors Ashtrom ( 27.5 % ) and engineers Alstom ( 20 % ) , plus service operators -- Connex ( 5 % ) . However , the principal agreement with the Dan Bus Company did not materialize . Veolia entered another principal agreement with Egged . Veolia sold its stake in CityPass and its shares in the contract for the maintenance of the light rail to Egged . The contract stipulates that Veolia would provide consultancy services to Egged until the company acquired the necessary expertise . Dan Bus Company has taken Veolia to court for exiting the principal agreement . Construction of Line 1 began in 2002 by DTC ( Dutch tramway company ) . Dubbed the `` Red Line '' , it initially has 23 stations on a new 1,435 mm ( 4 ft 8 ⁄ in ) ( standard gauge	Jerusalem Light Rail
197	198	) twin - track 13.8 kilometres ( 8.6 mi ) alignment . It runs from Pisgat Ze'ev in north - east Jerusalem , south along Road 1 ( intercity ) to Jaffa Road ( Rehov Yaffo ) . From there , it runs along Jaffa Road westward to the Jerusalem Central Bus Station , and continues to the southwest , crossing the Chords Bridge along Herzl Boulevard to the Beit HaKerem neighborhood , finishing just beyond Mount Herzl at the northern edge of Bayit VeGan . The first test run for this route was on February 24 , 2010 . The laying of the railroad tracks was completed on June 15 , 2010 . Delays ( edit ) Inauguration of the light rail service was postponed four times . The initial date was January 2009 , deferred to August 2010 due to funding problems and lack of staff . When it was announced that signals for the trains was not compatible with Israeli stop light systems , CityPass was given until April 2011 , but after the problem persisted and other safety issues were not resolved , an August 2011 date was settled on , and service was to begin without giving priority to trains at traffic lights . As a result , travel time for the full route began at 80 minutes instead of the planned 42 , until final synchronization of the lights is completed . When the light rail started operating on Friday , August 19 ,	Jerusalem Light Rail
198	199	2011 , there were also air conditioning issues and electrical and communications problems , one of them making trains suddenly `` disappear '' and then `` reappear '' on the screens of the control center near French Hill . In addition to these mishaps , the computerized ticketing system collapsed a few days before the inauguration . After arbitration between CityPass and government officials , it was decided that the trains would begin limited operation as scheduled . During the trial period , only 14 of the 21 trains were put into operation , departing every 21 minutes , and travel was free of charge . Full revenue service began on December 1 , 2011 . Development along the route ( edit ) Jerusalem light rail on Jaffa Road , October 26 , 2011 As part of the light rail project , CityPass plans to install blind - friendly traffic lights along the route , and has developed a number of sites along the route , such as Davidka Square . In late 2009 , trees were planted along the line . The species selected were deemed suitable to the Jerusalem climate , hardy enough to withstand the city 's cold winters while providing shade in summer . Over 3,500 trees were planted along the route in 2009 -- 11 . The genera include platanus , ash and types of oak . In March 2011 , however , the Ministry of Transportation objected to having trees adjacent to the route	Jerusalem Light Rail

Chords bridge ( edit ) Main article : Jerusalem Chords Bridge The Chords Bridge is a cantilever spar cable - stayed bridge designed by the Spanish architect and engineer Santiago Calatrava , built for the light rail , close to the most frequently used entrance to Jerusalem , in the neighborhood of Kiryat Moshe . The bridge carries the trams in a grade separated manner over a busy road intersection . Incorporated in the bridge is a glass - sided pedestrian crossing , enabling pedestrians to cross unimpeded from the Kiryat Moshe area to the Central Bus Station grounds . The bridge , which cost about $70 million ( NIS 246 million ) , was inaugurated on June 25 , 2008 . Integrated transportation plans ( edit ) Map of the Jerusalem Light Rail Bus and train connection ( edit ) The Jerusalem Central Bus Station is slated to become a major passenger transportation hub . The Jerusalem Binyanei HaUma Railway Station is being built for the new high - speed railway to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion Airport . Passengers will also be able to board the existing intercity bus services at the station . A park and ride facility was built near Mount Herzl , consisting of a multi-storey car park with the first line terminal on its roof , which is actually at the street level of Herzl Boulevard . An additional parking lot was erected adjacent to the	Jerusalem Light Rail
200	201	Ammunition Hill stop . Extension plans ( edit ) The Jerusalem Municipality has plans to build eight bus rapid transit ( BRT ) and light rail lines across the city . Extensions of the red line are under construction in both directions : to Neve Yaakov in the North and to Kiryat Menachem in the South . A further extension to the Ein Kerem campus of Hadassah Medical Center is planned . This extension will include an underground section without stops west of Ora junction . Red line ( edit ) Main article : Red Line ( Jerusalem Light Rail ) Initial extensions to the Red Line were planned to the neighborhoods of Neve Yaakov in northern East Jerusalem and Ein Karem ( near Hadassah Hospital ) in the southwest . Former mayor Uri Lupolianski stated that they would be completed at the same time as the rest of the line . In 2008 , French company Egis Rail won an 11.9 million Euro contract to carry out some of the design work . However , in March 2009 , CityPass turned down implementing the project . In May 2010 the Jerusalem Municipality announced that the extensions would be built by the state authorities rather than a private company . The extension to Hadassah Hospital from Mount Herzl is particularly challenging and will involve a complex path with complicated bridging works . As of summer 2012 , while works on the extension have not begun , the line 's final	Jerusalem Light Rail
201	202	terminal station , next to Hadassah 's new inpatient building is nevertheless being built during the construction of the inpatient building -- in order not to disrupt hospital operations later after the new building will be completed . Also planned are branches to the Red Line that would create a `` campus line '' connecting the Mount Scopus and Givat Ram campuses of the Hebrew University . Blue line ( edit ) The blue line from Ramot to Gilo is currently served by buses moving on a dedicated bus lane , and is planned to be converted to light rail . It will include an underground section in the city center with three underground stops : Mea Shearim , Tzfania and Bar Ilan . The 23 km Blue Line will run from the Ramot district in the northwest , through the city centre up to Talpiot and Gilo , with branches to Malkha and Mount Scopus . It will have 42 stops and ridership is predicted at 250 000 passengers / day . The Blue line , scheduled to open in 2023 , was approved on December 3 , 2017 by the district committee for planning and construction . Green line ( edit ) Main article : Green Line ( Jerusalem Light Rail ) The 19 6 km Green line will link the two campuses of the Hebrew University and continue south via Pat junction to Gilo . It will pass the Binyanei - Hauma terminus of the A1 fast	Jerusalem Light Rail
202	203	line railway , then cross the existing Red Line tram route and run to Mount Scopus . There would be 36 stops , and ridership is predicted at 200 000 passengers / day . The line was approved by the Jerusalem city council in June 2016 . Infrastructure tenders have been issued . North -- south BRT line ( edit ) Bus rapid transit along Keren HaYesod Street The first bus rapid transit ( BRT ) line , a feeder line to the Light Rail , is a dedicated bus line running along Hebron Road in south Jerusalem , northwards to Keren HaYesod Street , and from there to King George V Street , where it crosses the path of the light rail and continues along Straus Street towards Kikar HaShabbat to Yehezkel Street and Shmuel HaNavi Street , towards Golda Meir Boulevard in the direction of Ramot . Buses on this route are operated by the Egged Transportation Cooperative . Tour buses , Arab buses and mini-buses that run from the Damascus Gate also use the line . The bus stops on this route have been designed to match the tram stops on the Red Line . Rolling stock ( edit ) Initial rolling stock consists of 46 Citadis 302 100 % low - floor five - module units manufactured at Alstom 's Aytré factory . All axles are driven to handle gradients up to 9 % . The first car was delivered via the Port of Ashdod in	Jerusalem Light Rail
203	204	September 2007 . The maintenance and storage depot is on a 10 acres ( 40,000 m ) site near French Hill in northern East Jerusalem . The route and vehicles are monitored from the control center , and trams are driven under line - of - sight principles with built - in priority at many road intersections . The fare collection and ticketing system is supplied by Affiliated Computer Services . Alstom train for use in the light rail Operation ( edit ) Play media Video of light rail on Jaffa Street The French - based company Veolia Transport , which held 5 % of CityPass 's shares , was originally meant to operate the light rail . However , due to pressure from groups united in the Derail Veolia campaign , operating within the context of the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions campaign , in September 2009 Veolia agreed to sell part of its share in the project to the Dan Bus Company for $15 -- 20 million . The sale was however unsuccessful , and Veolia agreed in October 2010 to sell its stake to Egged instead . As of December 2011 , the sale to Egged was reported to have been held up by the Israeli state . Travel over the complete Red line is due to take 42 minutes from Pisgat Ze'ev at one end to Mount Herzl at the other ( as of August 2012 , the travel time is 46 minutes ) . The	Jerusalem Light Rail
204	205	line operates Sunday through Thursday , from 5 : 30 am to 11 : 30 pm , on Friday up to an hour before sundown and not during the Shabbat or Jewish holidays , resuming half an hour after Shabbat or the Holiday ends . Commencing August 2 , 2015 , frequency will be every 3 minutes during rush hours and every 6 minutes in the daytime and at night . It is expected to carry up to 23,000 passengers an hour during peak morning rush hours . The light rail operates at a maximum speed of 50 km / h ( 31 mph ) . New regulations were passed by the government in regard to vehicle behavior vis - a-vis the light rail . Operations were affected by a labor dispute in 2011 . In May 2012 , security personnel complained of poor working condition and lack of transparency from their employers -- allegations which were denied by the security company .

Ridership ( edit ) Year Annual Ridership ( million passengers ) 2015 36.405 2016 37.633 2017 42.457 Controversy ( edit ) Budgetary problems and criticism of operator ( edit ) Light rail under construction The financial management of the project was criticized in May 2008 by State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss , who reported a 128 % deviation in funds , from an estimated NIS 500 million to NIS 1.14 billion . It was also noted that the government had spent NIS 1.2 billion on the project up to 2007 , which pointed to a further deviation	Jerusalem Light Rail
206	207	. The total cost of the initial line ( not including the planned extensions ) is estimated at 3.8 billion NIS ( approx . US $1.1 billion ) . In 2002 , the government of Israel signed an agreement with the operator , CityPass , regarding the future operation of the light rail . The agreement was made public in 2012 , and generated controversy over a clause where the government pledged to remove competition to the light rail from other public transportation . For instance , there would not be two consecutive bus stops on the same line adjacent to the light rail 's route . CityPass stated that before the light rail there had not been competition either , with all public transportation being operated by Egged . CityPass inspector handing out a fine Upon buying a ticket , each traveler is required to validate it inside the rail car , and the fine for not doing so ( or not buying a ticket ) is NIS 186 . This has created considerable controversy , and CityPass has been accused of handing out fines indiscriminately in order to raise its income -- the company made NIS 2.4 million in the first half year on fines . Litigative and legislative efforts have been made to curb CityPass 's power in this regard . An appeal committee will be created to deal with requests to cancel fines . In 2012 Haviv Rettig Gur criticized CityPass for automatically expiring single ride	Jerusalem Light Rail
207	208	tickets at the end of the day they were purchased even if they were never used . CityPass does not provide refunds . Rettig Gur wrote `` Though I have no proof , I am convinced the expiration policy is intentional . '' As of 2015 this policy still remains in place . Pinchas M. Orbach identified a technical issue where a customer would not be able to use a legitimate transfer . He wrote `` The CityPass Rav Kav system is unable to properly read a ' 90 minute transfer from Egged ' if a new virtual punch card was purchased on the Rav Kav in between the original Egged ride and the Light Rail ride . '' Therefore , even if a passenger was traveling within the 90 minutes allowed for free transfers an inspector using CityPass equipment to read the Rav Kav would erroneously believe the fare was not paid and issue a fine . CityPass did not respond to the report nor fix the problem . Air pollution and effects on traffic ( edit ) The project was also criticized for increasing air pollution in Jerusalem during construction . However , it was credited with reducing air pollution on Jaffa Road by 80 % when the latter was converted to an LRT - only way . In October 2010 , residents of Jerusalem filed a NIS 1.2 billion class - action lawsuit against CityPass for the effects of the traffic congestion that the project 's construction	Jerusalem Light Rail
208	209	created , but the Jerusalem district court ruled that the company could only be sued for air and noise pollution . Nir Barkat , mayor of Jerusalem , was also critical of the congestion . In March 2009 , he proposed canceling the project after the first two lines were completed and replacing the rest of the planned rail network with buses . The closure of Jaffa Street has diverted the bus traffic to a nearby street causing a rise in traffic accidents there . Controversy outside Israel ( edit ) The project was criticized because the Red Line route passes through territories Israel has held under occupation since the Six - Day War to service Israeli settlements such as French Hill and Pisgat Ze'ev . In consequence , Dutch bank ASN divested from Veolia Environnement . Both Veolia and Alstom were sued by the Palestine Liberation Organisation and French advocacy group Association France - Palestine Solidarité in the French courts . In 2013 , the Versailles Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the French companies , and ordered the Palestinian groups to pay $117,000 in legal costs to the French companies . In the 32 - page verdict , the judges ruled that the light rail did not violate international law . A large proportion of the train 's passengers are Arabs . In May 2009 it was reported that the Palestinian Authority had been urging Saudi Arabia through back channels to pressure Alstom and Veolia to abandon	Jerusalem Light Rail
209	210	the project in return for the multi-billion dollar Haramain High Speed Rail Project and the $25 billion Gulf Railway project . The contract for the Haramain project was eventually awarded to a rival bidder . In November 2009 , under the banner of Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions ( BDS ) , Palestinian organizations launched a campaign on the six Gulf Cooperation Council states to withhold lucrative contracts for the Gulf railway project from the two companies unless they comply with demands to withdraw from the Jerusalem project . Veolia decided to sell its interests in the light railway , first to Dan Bus Company in 2009 , and later to Egged , as part of a strategy to exit the transportation market . Veolia 's interest in the Jerusalem Light Rail , together with its other transport business , was injected in 2011 in new subsidiary Veolia Transdev , jointly owned by Veolia and French financial institution Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations . After poor financial results , Veolia announced in December 2011 that it intended to exit the transport sector altogether and sell its stake in Veolia Transdev . In a 2009 report , the United Nations Human Rights Council described the Jerusalem Light Rail as infrastructure servicing Israeli settlements . The following year , the Human Rights Council condemned the decision to operate a tramway between west Jerusalem and Pisgat Ze'ev `` in violation of international law '' and relevant United Nations resolutions . The Council resolution	Jerusalem Light Rail
210	211	was adopted with 46 votes in favor and 1 against ( USA ) . In the United Kingdom , an Early Day Motion was tabled in parliament in 2012 against the financing of illegal activity in the West Bank . After referring to the Jerusalem Light Rail , the motion called on the UK government to support EU legislation to ensure `` that economic operators aiding and abetting the building , maintenance or servicing of illegal Israeli settlements be excluded from public contracts in the EU '' . July 2014 riots ( edit ) In July 2014 , Arab rioters caused substantial damage to three stations in Arab neighborhoods as well as other system infrastructure , and left graffiti with `` Death to the Jews '' and other slogans . Rioting and incessant `` rock attacks '' inflicted on trains in the Beit Hanina and Shuafat areas have made the train route subject to closures restricting passengers to stations south of Givat HaMivtar . Damage to trains caused two - thirds of CityPass ' fleet to be taken offline in an ongoing basis through October , 2014 . Archaeological findings ( edit ) While tracks for the light rail were being laid in Shuafat , the remains of an ancient Roman -- Jewish settlement were discovered . The settlement was described as a `` sophisticated community impeccably planned by the Roman authorities , with orderly rows of houses and two fine public bathhouses to the north '' . The findings	Jerusalem Light Rail
211	212	are said be the first indication of active Jewish settlement in the Jerusalem area after the city fell in 70 CE .

It is the most sacred site in Islam . It is considered by Muslims to be the bayt Allāh , the `` House of God '' , and has a similar role to the Tabernacle and Holy of Holies in Judaism . Wherever they are in the world , Muslims are expected to face the Kaaba when performing salat or salah ( prayer )	Kaaba
226	227	. From any point in the world , the direction facing the Kaaba is called the qibla . One of the Five Pillars of Islam requires every Muslim who is able to do so to perform the hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime . Multiple parts of the hajj require pilgrims to make tawaf , the circumambulation seven times around the Kaaba in a counter-clockwise direction . Tawaf is also performed by pilgrims during the umrah ( lesser pilgrimage ) . However , the most significant times are during the hajj , when millions of pilgrims gather to circle the building within a 5 - day period . In 2013 , the number of pilgrims coming from outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to perform hajj was officially reported as 1,379,531 . In 2014 , Saudi Arabia reported having completed Hajj permits for 1,389,053 international pilgrims and 63,375 for residents .

227	228	2016 ) The literal meaning of the Arabic word ka ` bah ( كَعْبَة ) is `` cube . '' In the Qur'an , the Ka'ba has been also mentioned as `` al - Bayt '' ( Arabic : البیت , the house ) , `` al - Bayt al - Haram '' ( Arabic : البیت الحرام , the sacred house ) , `` al - Bayt al - ' Atiq '' ( Arabic : البیت العتیق , the old house ) , and `` al - Bayt al - Muharram '' ( Arabic : البیت المحرم , respected house ) . The mosque surrounding the Ka'ba is called al - Masjid al - Haram . According to some reports , in ancient times , the Ka'ba was also called `` Qadis '' ( Arabic : القادس , holy ) , `` Nadhir '' ( Arabic : الناذر ) . Architecture and interior ( edit ) The Kaaba is a prismal stone structure made of granite . It is approximately 13.1 m ( 43 ft ) high ( some claim 12.03 m ( 39.5 ft ) ) , with sides measuring 11.03 m ( 36.2 ft ) by 12.86 m ( 42.2 ft ) . Inside the Kaaba , the floor is made of marble and limestone . The interior walls , measuring 13 m ( 43 ft ) by 9 m ( 30 ft ) , are clad with tiled , white marble halfway to the roof ,	Kaaba
228	229	with darker trimmings along the floor . The floor of the interior stands about 2.2 m ( 7.2 ft ) above the ground area where tawaf is performed . The wall directly adjacent to the entrance of the Kaaba has six tablets inlaid with inscriptions , and there are several more tablets along the other walls . Along the top corners of the walls runs a green cloth embroidered with gold Qur'anic verses . Caretakers anoint the marble cladding with the same scented oil used to anoint the Black Stone outside . Three pillars ( some erroneously report two ) stand inside the Kaaba , with a small altar or table set between one and the other two . ( It has been claimed that this table is used for the placement of perfumes or other items . ) Lamp - like objects ( possible lanterns or crucible censers ) hang from the ceiling . The ceiling itself is of a darker colour , similar in hue to the lower trimming . A golden door -- the bāb al - tawbah ( also romanized as Baabut Taubah , and meaning `` Door of Repentance '' ) -- on the right wall ( right of the entrance ) opens to an enclosed staircase that leads to a hatch , which itself opens to the roof . Both the roof and ceiling ( collectively dual - layered ) are made of stainless steel - capped teak wood . A drawing of the	Kaaba

Al - Ḥajaru al - Aswad , `` the Black Stone '' , is located on the Kaaba 's eastern corner . Its northern corner is known as the Ruknu l - ʕĪrāqī , `` the Iraqi corner '' , its western as the Ruknu sh - Shāmī , `` the Levantine corner '' , and its southern as Ruknu l - Yamanī , `` the Yemeni corner '' taught by Imam Ali . The four corners of the Kaaba roughly point toward the four cardinal directions of the compass . Its major ( long ) axis is aligned with the rising of the star Canopus toward which its southern wall is directed , while its minor axis ( its east - west facades ) roughly align with the sunrise of summer solstice and the sunset of winter solstice . The entrance is a door set 2.13 m ( 7 ft ) above the ground on the north - eastern wall of the Kaaba , which acts as the façade . In 1979 the 300 kg gold doors made by chief artist Ahmad bin Ibrahim Badr , replaced the old silver doors made by his father , Ibrahim Badr in 1942 .

This is 90 cm ( 35 in ) in height and 1.5 m ( 4.9 ft ) in width , and is composed of white marble . At one time the space lying between the hatīm and the Kaaba belonged to the Kaaba itself , and for this reason it is not entered during the tawaf .

232	233	Pilgrimage ( edit ) Main articles : Hajj and Umrah The Sacred Mosque is the focal point of the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages that occur in the month of Dhu al - Hijjah in the Islamic calendar and at any time of the year , respectively . The Hajj pilgrimage is one of the Pillars of Islam , required of all able - bodied Muslims who can afford the trip . In recent times , about 1.8 million Muslims perform the Hajj every year . Some of the rituals performed by pilgrims are symbolic of historical incidents . For example , the incident of Hagar 's search for water is emulated by Muslims as they run between the two hills of Safa and Marwah whenever they visit Mecca . The Hajj is associated with the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad from the 7th century , but the ritual of pilgrimage to Mecca is considered by Muslims to stretch back thousands of years to the time of Prophet Ibrahim . History ( edit ) See also : Pre-Islamic Arabia and Jahiliyyah Islamic views on origin ( edit ) The Quran contains several verses regarding the origin of the Kaaba , it states that the Kaaba was the first House of Worship , and that it was built by Ibrahim and Ishmael on God 's instructions . Verily , the first House ( of worship ) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah ( Makkah ) , full of blessing ,	Kaaba
233	234	and a guidance for mankind . -- Quran , Chapter 3 ( Aale - Imran ) verse 96 Behold ! We gave the site , to Ibrahim , of the ( Sacred ) House , ( saying ) : `` Associate not anything ( in worship ) with Me ; and sanctify My House for those who compass it round , or stand up , or bow , or prostrate themselves ( therein in prayer ) . -- Quran , Chapter 22 ( Al Hajj ) verse 26 And remember Ibrahim and Ishmael raised the foundations of the House ( With this prayer ) : `` Our Lord ! Accept ( this service ) from us : For Thou art the All - Hearing , the All - knowing . -- Quran , Chapter 2 ( Al Bakarah ) verse 127 Ibn Kathir , the famous commentator on the Quran , mentions two interpretations among the Muslims on the origin of the Kaaba . One is that the shrine was a place of worship for Angels before the creation of man . Later , a temple was built on the location by Adam and Eve which was lost during the flood in Noah 's time and was finally rebuilt by Abraham and Ishmael as mentioned later in the Quran . Ibn Kathir regarded this tradition as weak and preferred instead the narration by Ali ibn Abi Talib that although several other temples might have preceded the Kaabah , it was	Kaaba
234	235	the first `` House of God '' , dedicated solely to Him , built by His instruction and sanctified and blessed by Him as stated in Quran 22 : 26 -- 29 . A Hadith in Sahih al - Bukhari states that the Kaaba was the First Mosque on Earth , and the Second Mosque was the Temple in Jerusalem . While Abraham was building the Kaaba , an angel brought to him the Black Stone which he placed in the eastern corner of the structure . Another stone was the Maqam - e-Ibrahim ( literally the Station of Abraham ) where Abraham stood for elevation while building the structure . The Black Stone and the Maqam - e-Ibrahim are believed by Muslims to be the only remnant of the original structure made by Abraham as naturally the remaining structure had to be demolished and rebuilt several times over history for maintenance purposes . After the construction was complete , God enjoined the descendants of Ishmael to perform an annual pilgrimage : the Hajj and the Korban , sacrifice of cattle . The vicinity of the shrine was also made a sanctuary where bloodshed and war were forbidden . According to Islamic tradition , over the millennia after Ishmael 's death , his progeny and the local tribes who settled around the oasis of Zam - Zam gradually turned to polytheism and idolatry . Several idols were placed within the Kaaba representing deities of different aspects of nature and different	Kaaba
235	236	tribes . Several heretical rituals were adopted in the Pilgrimage ( Hajj ) including doing naked circumambulation . In her book , Islam : A Short History , Karen Armstrong asserts that the Kaaba was officially dedicated to Hubal , a Nabatean deity , and contained 360 idols that probably represented the days of the year . But by Muhammad 's day , it seems that the Kaaba was venerated as the shrine of Allah , the High God . Once a year , tribes from all around the Arabian peninsula , whether Christian or pagan , would converge on Mecca to perform the Hajj , marking the widespread conviction that Allah was the same deity worshiped by monotheists . Guillaume in his translation of Ibn Ishaq , an early biographer of Muhammad , says the Ka'aba itself was addressed using a feminine grammatical form . Circumambulation was often performed naked by men and almost naked by women , and linked to ancient fertility rites . It is disputed whether Allah and Hubal were the same deity or different . Per a hypothesis by Uri Rubin and Christian Robin , Hubal was only venetrated by Quraysh and the Kaaba was first dedicated to Allah , a supreme god of individuals belonging to different tribes , while the pantheon of the gods of Quraysh was installed in Kaaba after they conquered Mecca a century before Muhammad 's time . Modern independent views on origin ( edit ) Ptolemy ( edit )	Kaaba
236	237	Writing in the Encyclopedia of Islam , Wensinck identifies Mecca with a place called Macoraba mentioned by Ptolemy and found in a 3rd - century BC map which suggests that Macoraba was Mecca . G.E. von Grunebaum states : `` Mecca is mentioned by Ptolemy . The name he gives it allows us to identify it as a South Arabian foundation created around a sanctuary . In Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam , Patricia Crone argues that the identification of Macoraba with Mecca is false and that Macoraba was a town in southern Arabia in what was then known as Arabia Felix . Her point of view was supported by some Islamic scholars and challenged by others . Ottoman tiles representing the Kaaba Diodorus Siculus ( edit ) The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus is believed to have mentioned the Kaabah in 60 -- 30 BC while describing the coast of Jeddah and its surrounding areas mentioned : The inhabitants of the land about the gulf , who are known as Banizomenes , find their food by hunting the land animals and eating their meat . And a temple has been set up there , which is very holy and exceedingly revered by all Arabians . -- Diodorus Siculus , Bibliotheca Historica , Book 3 Chapter 44 Edward Gibbon suggested that the Kaaba was mentioned by ancient Greek writer , Diodorus Siculus , before the Christian era : The genuine antiquity of Caaba ascends beyond the Christian era :	Kaaba
237	238	in describing the coast of the Red sea the Greek historian Diodorus has remarked , between the Thamudites and the Sabeans , a famous temple , whose superior sanctity was revered by all the Arabians ; the linen or silken veil , which is annually renewed by the Turkish emperor , was first offered by the Homerites , who reigned seven hundred years before the time of Mohammad . -- Edward Gibbon , Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire , Volume V , pp. 223 -- 24 Others ( edit ) Imoti contends that there were numerous such `` Kaaba '' sanctuaries in Arabia at one time , but this was the only one built of stone . The others also allegedly had counterparts of the Black Stone . There was a `` red stone '' , the deity of the south Arabian city of Ghaiman , and the `` white stone '' in the Kaaba of al - Abalat ( near the city of Tabala , south of Mecca ) . Grunebaum in Classical Islam points out that the experience of divinity of that period was often associated with stone fetishes , mountains , special rock formations , or `` trees of strange growth . '' The Kaaba was thought to be at the center of the world , with the Gate of Heaven directly above it . The Kaaba marked the location where the sacred world intersected with the profane ; the embedded Black Stone was a	Kaaba
238	239	further symbol of this as a meteorite that had fallen from the sky and linked heaven and earth . According to Sarwar , about 400 years before the birth of Muhammad , a man named `` Amr bin Lahyo bin Harath bin Amr ul - Qais bin Thalaba bin Azd bin Khalan bin Babalyun bin Saba '' , who was descended from Qahtan and was the king of Hijaz had placed a Hubal idol onto the roof of the Kaaba . This idol was one of the chief deities of the ruling tribe Quraysh . The idol was made of red agate and shaped like a human , but with the right hand broken off and replaced with a golden hand . When the idol was moved inside the Kaaba , it had seven arrows in front of it , which were used for divination . To maintain peace among the perpetually warring tribes , Mecca was declared a sanctuary where no violence was allowed within 20 miles ( 32 km ) of the Kaaba . This combat - free zone allowed Mecca to thrive not only as a place of pilgrimage , but also as a trading center . Many Muslim and academic historians stress the power and importance of the pre-Islamic Mecca . They depict it as a city grown rich on the proceeds of the spice trade . Crone believes that this is an exaggeration and that Mecca may only have been an outpost trading with nomads	Kaaba
239	240	for leather , cloth , and camel butter . Crone argues that if Mecca had been a well - known center of trade , it would have been mentioned by later authors such as Procopius , Nonnosus , or the Syrian church chroniclers writing in Syriac . The town is absent , however , from any geographies or histories written in the three centuries before the rise of Islam . According to the Encyclopædia Britannica , `` before the rise of Islam it was revered as a sacred sanctuary and was a site of pilgrimage . '' According to German historian Eduard Glaser , the name `` Kaaba '' may have been related to the southern Arabian or Ethiopian word `` mikrab '' , signifying a temple . Again , Crone disputes this etymology . In Samaritan literature , the Samaritan Book of the Secrets of Moses ( Asatir ) claims that Ishmael and his eldest son Nebaioth built the Kaaba as well as the city of Mecca . `` The Secrets of Moses '' or Asatir book was suggested by some opinion to have been compiled in the 10th century , while another opinion in 1927 suggested that it was written no later than the second half of the 3rd century BCE . Pre-Islamic era ( edit ) Prior to the spread of Islam throughout the Arabian Peninsula , the Kaaba was a holy site for the various Bedouin tribes of the area . Once every lunar year ,	Kaaba
240	241	the Bedouin tribes would make a pilgrimage to Mecca . Setting aside any tribal feuds , they would worship their pagan gods in the Kaaba and trade with each other in the city . Islam would later adopt the established traditions of the Bedouin tribes , such as encouragement of trade during the Hajj , but replacing the worship of their pagan gods with Allah . Muhammad 's era ( edit ) An illustration from the early 14th - century Persian Jami al - Tawarikh , inspired by the story of Muhammad and the Meccan clan elders lifting the Black Stone into place when the Kaaba was rebuilt in the early 600s During Muhammad 's time ( 570 -- 632 CE ) , the Kaaba was considered a holy and sacred site by the local Arabs and later Islam recognized it . Muhammad took part in the reconstruction of the Kaaba after its structure was damaged due to floods around 600 CE . Ibn Ishaq 's Sirat Rasūl Allāh , one of the biographies of Muhammad ( as reconstructed and translated by Guillaume ) , describes Muhammad settling a quarrel between Meccan clans as to which clan should set the Black Stone cornerstone in place . According to Ishaq 's biography , Muhammad 's solution was to have all the clan elders raise the cornerstone on a cloak , after which Muhammad set the stone into its final place with his own hands . Ibn Ishaq says that the timber	Kaaba
241	242	for the reconstruction of the Kaaba came from a Greek ship that had been wrecked on the Red Sea coast at Shu'ayba and that the work was undertaken by a Coptic carpenter called Baqum . Muhammad 's night journey is said to have taken him from the Kaaba to the Temple Mount and heavenwards from there . Muslims initially considered Jerusalem as their qibla and faced that direction while offering prayers ; however , pilgrimage to the Kaaba was considered a religious duty though its rites were not yet finalized . During the first half of Muhammad 's time as a prophet while he was at Mecca , he and his followers were severely persecuted which eventually led to their migration to Medina in 622 CE . In 624 CE the direction of the Qiblah ( Prayer Direction ) was changed from Jerusalem to the Kaabah in Mecca . In 628CE Muhammad led a group of Muslims towards Mecca with the intention of performing the minor pilgrimage ( Umrah ) at the Kaaba , though he was n't allowed by the people of Mecca to do so , he secured a peace treaty with them called the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah , which allowed the Muslims to freely perform pilgrimage at the Kaaba from the following year . At the culmination of his mission , in 629 CE , Muhammad conquered Mecca with a Muslim army . His first action was to remove statues and images from the Kaaba . According	Kaaba
242	243	to reports collected by Ibn Ishaq and al - Azraqi , Muhammad spared a painting of Mary and Jesus , and a fresco of Abraham ; but according to Ibn Hisham all pictures were erased . Narrated Abdullah : When the Prophet entered Mecca on the day of the Conquest , there were 360 idols around the Ka'bah . The Prophet started striking them with a stick he had in his hand and was saying , `` Truth has come and Falsehood has Vanished ... ( Qur'an 17 : 81 ) '' -- Sahih Al - Bukhari , Book 59 , Hadith 583 After the conquest Muhammad restated the sanctity and holiness of Mecca , including its Great Mosque , in Islam . He performed a lesser Pilgrimage ( Umrah ) in 629 CE , followed by the Greater Pilgrimage ( Hajj ) in 632 CE called the Farewell Pilgrimage since Muhammad prophesied his impending death on this event . After Muhammad ( edit ) The site of Kaaba in 1880 The Kaaba in 1907 The Kaaba has been repaired and reconstructed many times since Muhammad 's day . The structure was severely damaged by fire on 3 Rabi I ( Sunday , 31 October 683 CE ) , during the first siege of Mecca in the war between the Umayyads and Abd - Allah ibn al - Zubayr , an early Muslim who ruled Mecca for many years between the death of ʿAli and the consolidation of Umayyad power	Kaaba
243	244	. Ibn al - Zubayr rebuilt it to include the hatīm . He did so on the basis of a tradition ( found in several hadith collections ) that the hatīm was a remnant of the foundations of the Abrahamic Kaaba , and that Muhammad himself had wished to rebuild so as to include it . The Kaaba was bombarded with stones in the second siege of Mecca in 692 , in which the Umayyad army was led by al - Hajjaj ibn Yusuf . The fall of the city and the death of Ibn al - Zubayr allowed the Umayyads under ʿAbdu l - Malik ibn Marwan to finally reunite all the Islamic possessions and end the long civil war . In 693 CE , ʿAbdu l - Malik had the remnants of al - Zubayr 's Kaaba razed , and rebuilt on the foundations set by the Quraysh . The Kaaba returned to the cube shape it had taken during Muhammad 's time . During the Hajj of 930 CE , the Qarmatians attacked Mecca , defiled the Zamzam Well with the bodies of pilgrims and stole the Black Stone , taking it to the oasis region of Eastern Arabia known as al - Aḥsāʾ , where it remained until the Abbasids ransomed it in 952 CE . The basic shape and structure of the Kaaba have not changed since then . After heavy rains and flooding in 1629 , the walls of the Kaaba collapsed and the	Kaaba
244	245	Mosque was damaged . The same year , during the reign of Ottoman Emperor Murad IV , the Kaaba was rebuilt with granite stones from Mecca , and the Mosque was renovated . The Kaaba 's appearance has not changed since then . The Kaaba is depicted on the reverse of 500 Saudi Riyal , and the 2000 Iranian rial banknotes .

It is also known as Kāṭhaka Upanishad , and is listed as number 3 in the Muktika canon of 108 Upanishads . The Katha Upanishad consists of two chapters ( Adhyāyas ) , each divided into three sections (	Katha Upanishad
296	297	Vallis ) . The first Adhyaya is considered to be of older origin than the second . The Upanishad is the legendary story of a little boy , Nachiketa -- the son of Sage Vajasravasa , who meets Yama ( the Indian deity of death ) . Their conversation evolves to a discussion of the nature of man , knowledge , Atman ( Soul , Self ) and moksha ( liberation ) . The chronology of Katha Upanishad is unclear and contested , with Buddhism scholars stating it was likely composed after the early Buddhist texts ( fifth century BCE ) , and Hinduism scholars stating it was likely composed before the early Buddhist texts in 1st part of 1st millennium BCE . The Kathaka Upanishad is an important ancient Sanskrit corpus of the Vedanta sub-schools , and an influential Śruti to the diverse schools of Hinduism . It asserts that `` Atman ( Soul , Self ) exists '' , teaches the precept `` seek Self - knowledge which is Highest Bliss '' , and expounds on this premise like the other primary Upanishads of Hinduism . The Upanishad presents ideas that contrast Hinduism with Buddhism 's assertion that `` Soul , Self does not exist '' , and Buddhism 's precept that one should seek `` Emptiness ( Śūnyatā ) which is Highest Bliss '' . The detailed teachings of Katha Upanishad have been variously interpreted , as Dvaita ( dualistic ) and as Advaita ( non-dualistic )	Katha Upanishad
297	298	. It is among the most widely studied Upanishads . Katha Upanishad was translated into Persian in 17th century , copies of which were then translated into Latin and distributed in Europe . Max Müller and many others have translated it . Other philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer praised it , Edwin Arnold rendered it in verse as `` The Secret of Death '' , and Ralph Waldo Emerson credited Katha Upanishad for the central story at the end of his essay Immortality , as well as his poem `` Brahma '' .

Katha is also the name of	Katha Upanishad
298	299	a sage , credited as the founder of a branch of the Krishna Yajur - veda , as well as the term for a female pupil or follower of Kathas school of Yajurveda . Paul Deussen notes that the Katha Upanishad uses words that symbolically embed and creatively have multiple meanings . For example , a closely pronounced word Katha ( Sanskrit : कथा ) literally means `` story , legend , conversation , speech , tale '' . All of these related meanings are relevant to the Katha Upanishad . Nachiketa , the boy and a central character in the Katha Upanishad legend , similarly , has closely related words with roots and meanings relevant to the text . Paul Deussen suggests Na kṣiti and Na aksiyete , which are word plays of and pronounced similar to Nachiketa , means `` non-decay , or what does not decay '' , a meaning that is relevant to second boon portion of the Nachiketa story . Similarly , Na jiti is another word play and means `` that which can not be vanquished '' , which is contextually relevant to the Nachiketa 's third boon . Both Whitney and Deussen independently suggest yet another variation to Nachiketa , with etymological roots that is relevant to Katha Upanishad : the word Na - ciketa also means `` I do not know , or he does not know '' . Some of these Sanskrit word plays are incorporated within the Upanishad 's text	Katha Upanishad
299	300	. Like Taittiriya Upanishad of Yajurveda , each section of the Katha Upanishad is called a Valli ( वल्ली ) , which literally means a medicinal vine - like climbing plant that grows independently yet is attached to a main tree . Paul Deussen states that this symbolic terminology is apt and likely reflects the root and nature of the Upanishads in Black Yajur veda , which too is largely independent of the liturgical Yajur Veda , and is attached to the main text . Chronology ( edit ) The chronology of Katha Upanishad is unclear and contested by scholars . All opinions rest on scanty evidence , an analysis of archaism , style and repetitions across texts , driven by assumptions about likely evolution of ideas , and on presumptions about which philosophy might have influenced which other Indian philosophies . Buddhism scholars such as Richard King date Katha Upanishad 's composition roughly to the 5th century BCE , chronologically placing it after the first Buddhist Pali canons . Hinduism scholars such as Stephen Phillips note the disagreement between modern scholars . Phillips dates Katha Upanishad as having been composed after Brihadaranyaka , Chandogya , Isha , Taittiriya , Aitareya and Kena , but before Mundaka , Prasna , Mandukya , Svetasvatara and Maitri Upanishads , as well as before the earliest Buddhist Pali and Jaina canons . Ranade posits a view similar to Phillips , with slightly different ordering , placing Katha 's chronological composition in the fourth	Katha Upanishad
300	301	group of ancient Upanishads along with Mundaka and Svetasvatara . Paul Deussen too considers Katha Upanishad to be a post-prose , yet earlier stage Upanishad composed about the time Kena and Isha Upanishads were , because of the poetic , mathematical metric structure of its hymns . Winternitz considers the Kathaka Upanishad as pre-Buddhist , pre-Jaina literature . Structure ( edit ) The Katha Upanishad has two chapters , each with three sections ( valli ) , thus a total of six sections . The first section has 29 verses , the second section 25 verses , and the third presents 17 . The second chapter opens with the fourth section of the Katha Upanishad and has 15 verses , while the fifth valli also has 15 verses . The final section has 17 verses . The first chapter with the first three vallis is considered older , because the third section ends with a structure in Sanskrit that is typically found at closing of other Upanishads , and also because the central ideas are repeated though expanded in the last three sections , that is the second chapter . This , however , does not imply a significant gap between the two chapters , both chapters are considered ancient , and from 1st millennium BCE . The origin of the story of the little boy named Nachiketa , contained in Katha Upanishad is of a much older origin . Nachiketa is mentioned in the verses of chapter 3.11 of	Katha Upanishad
301	302	Taittiriya Brahmana , both as a similar story , and as the name of one of five fire arrangements for rituals , along with Savitra , Caturhotra , Vaisvasrja and Aruna Agni . The style and structure suggests that some of the verses in Katha Upanishad , such as 1.1. 8 , 1.1. 16 - 1.1. 18 , 1.1. 28 among others , are non-philosophical , do not fit with the rest of the text , and are likely to be later insertion and interpolations .

302	303	son questions his father - first Valli ( edit ) The Upanishad opens with the story of Vajasravasa , also called Aruni Auddalaki Gautama , who gives away all his worldly possessions . However , his son Nachiketa ( Sanskrit : नचिकेता ) sees the charitable sacrifice as a farce , because all those worldly things have already been used to exhaustion , and are of no value to the recipients . The cows given away , for example , were so old that they had ' drank - their - last - water ' ( पीतोदकाः ) , ' eaten - their - last - grass ' ( जग्धतृणाः ) , ' do n't give milk ' ( दुग्धदोहाः ) , ' who are barren ' ( निरिन्द्रियाः ) . Concerned , the son asks his father , `` Dear father , to whom will you give me away ? '' He said it a second , and then a third time . The father , seized by anger , replied : `` To Death , I give you away . '' -- Nachiketa , Katha Upanishad , 1.1. 1 - 1.1. 4 Nachiketa does not die , but accepts his father 's gifting him to Death , by visiting the abode of Yama - the deity of death in Indian mythology . Nachiketa arrives , but Yama is not in his abode . Nachiketa as guest goes hungry for three nights , states verse 9 of the first	Katha Upanishad
303	304	Valli of Katha Upanishad . Yama arrives and is apologetic for this dishonor to the guest , so he offers Nachiketa three wishes . Nachiketa ' first wish is that Yama discharge him from the abode of death , back to his family , and that his father be calm , well - disposed , not resentful and same as he was before when he returns . Yama grants the first wish immediately , states verse 1.1. 11 of Katha Upanishad . For his second wish , Nachiketa prefaces his request with the statement that heaven is a place where there is no fear , no anxiety , no old age , no hunger , no thirst , no sorrow . He then asks Yama , in verse 1.1. 13 of Katha Upanishad to be instructed as to the proper execution of fire ritual that enables a human being to secure heaven . Yama responds by detailing the fire ritual , including how the bricks should be arranged , and how the fire represents the building of the world . Nachiketa remembers what Yama tells him , repeats the ritual , a feat which pleases Yama , and he declares that this fire ritual will thereafter be called the `` Nachiketa fires '' . Yama adds that along with `` three Nachiketa fires '' , anyone who respects three bonds ( with mother , father and teacher ) , does three kinds of karma ( rituals , studies and charity	Katha Upanishad
304	305	) , and understands the knowledge therein , becomes free of sorrow . Nachiketa then asks for his third wish , asking Yama in verse 1.1. 20 , about the doubt that human beings have about `` what happens after a person dies ? Does he continue to exist in another form ? or not ? '' The remaining verse of first Valli of Katha Upanishad is expression of reluctance by Yama in giving a straight `` yes or no '' answer . Yama states that even gods doubt and are uncertain about that question , and urges Nachiketa to pick another wish . Nachiketa says that if gods doubt that , then he `` Yama '' as deity of death ought to be the only one who knows the answer . Yama offers him all sorts of worldly wealth and pleasures instead , but Nachiketa says human life is short , asks Yama to keep the worldly wealth and pleasures to himself , declares that pompous wealth , lust and pleasures are fleeting and vain , then insists on knowing the nature of Atman ( Soul ) and sticks to his question , `` what happens after death ? '' The theory of good versus dear - second Valli ( edit ) Yama teaches Atma vidya to Nachiketa Yama begins his teaching by distinguishing between preya ( प्रेय , प्रिय , dear , pleasant ) , and shreya ( श्रेय , good , beneficial excellence ) . Different is	Katha Upanishad
305	306	the good and different is the dear , they both , having different aims , fetter you men ; He , who chooses for himself the good , comes to wellbeing , he , who chooses the dear , loses the goal . The good and the dear approach the man , The wise man , pondering over both , distinguishes them ; The wise one chooses the good over the dear , The fool , acquisitive and craving , chooses the dear . -- Yama , Katha Upanishad , 1.2. 1 - 1.2. 2 The verses 1.2. 4 through 1.2. 6 of Katha Upanishad then characterizes Knowledge / Wisdom as the pursuit of good , and Ignorance / Delusion as the pursuit of pleasant . The verses 1.2. 7 through 1.2. 11 of Katha Upanishad state Knowledge / Wisdom and the pursuit of good is difficult yet eternal , while Ignorance / Delusion and the pursuit of the pleasant is easy yet transient . Knowledge requires effort , and often not comprehended by man even when he reads it or hears it or by internal argument . The pursuit of Knowledge and the good , can be taught , learnt and thus realized . A similar discussion and distinction between the pleasant and the beneficial is found in ancient Greek philosophy , such as in Phaedrus by Plato . Atman exists , the theory of Yoga and the essence of Vedas - second Valli ( edit ) Katha Upanishad	Katha Upanishad
306	307	, in verses 1.2. 12 asserts Atman -- Soul , Self -- exists , though it is invisible and full of mystery . It is ancient , and recognizable by Yoga ( meditation on one 's self ) , states Katha Upanishad . This is one of the earliest mentions of Yoga in ancient Sanskrit literature , in the context of Self - development and meditation . तं दुर्दर्शं गूढमनुप्रविष्टं गुहाहितं गह्वरेष्ठं पुराणम् । अध्यात्मयोगाधिगमेन देवं मत्वा धीरो हर्षशोकौ जहाति ॥ १२ ॥ He ( the Atman ) , difficult to be seen , full of mystery , the Ancient , primaeval one , concealed deep within , He who , by yoga means of meditation on his self , comprehends Atman within him as God , He leaves joy and sorrow far behind . -- Katha Upanishad , 1.2. 12 In verses 1.2. 14 through 1.2. 22 , the Katha Upanishad asserts that the essence of Veda is to make man liberated and free , look past what has happened and what has not happened , free from the past and the future , refocus his attention past Ignorance to Knowledge , to the means of blissful existence beyond joy and sorrow . This is achievable through realization of Atman - Brahman , asserts Katha Upanishad , and this essence is reminded in the Vedas through the word Om ( ॐ , Aum ) , state verses 1.2. 15 - 1.2. 16 . That syllable , Aum , is	Katha Upanishad
307	308	in Brahman , means Brahman , means the Highest , means the Blissful within . Yama , as the spokesman in the second Valli of the Katha Upanishad asserts that man must not fear anyone , anything , not even death , because the true essence of man , his Atman is neither born nor dies , he is eternal , he is Brahman . These passages have been widely studied , and inspired Emerson among others , The seer ( Atman , Self ) is not born , nor does he die , He does not originate from anybody , nor does he become anybody , Eternal , ancient one , he remains eternal , he is not killed , even though the body is killed . If the killer thinks that he kills , if the killed thinks that he is killed , they do not understand ; for this one does not kill , nor is that one killed . The Self ( Atman ) , smaller than small , greater than great , is hidden in the heart of each creature , Free from avarice , free from grief , peaceful and content , he sees the supreme glory of Atman . -- Katha Upanishad , 1.2. 18 - 1.2. 20 In final verses of the second Valli , the Katha Upanishad asserts that Atman - knowledge , or Self - realization , is not attained by instruction , not arguments nor reasoning from scriptures .	Katha Upanishad
308	309	It is comprehended by oneself through meditation and introspection . It is not attained by those who do not abstain from misconduct , not those who are restless nor composed , not those whose mind is not calm and tranquil , but only those who live ethically , are composed , tranquil , internally peaceful , search within and examine their own nature . Similar ideas are repeated in the Mundaka Upanishad in chapter 3.2 , another classic ancient scripture of Hinduism . The parable of the chariot - third Valli ( edit ) The third Valli of Katha Upanishad presents the parable of the chariot , to highlight how Atman , body , mind , senses and empirical reality relate to a human being . Know that the Atman is the rider in the chariot , and the body is the chariot , Know that the Buddhi ( intelligence , ability to reason ) is the charioteer , and Manas ( mind ) is the reins . The senses are called the horses , the objects of the senses are their paths , Formed out of the union of the Atman , the senses and the mind , him they call the `` enjoyer '' . -- Katha Upanishad , 1.3. 3 - 1.3. 4 The Katha Upanishad asserts that one who does not use his powers of reasoning , whose senses are unruly and mind unbridled , his life drifts in chaos and confusion , his existence entangled	Katha Upanishad
309	310	in samsara . Those who use their intelligence , have their senses calm and under reason , they live a life of bliss and liberation , which is the highest place of Vishnu . Whitney clarifies that `` Vishnu '' appears in Vedas as a form of Sun , and `` Vishnu 's highest place '' is a Vedic phrase that means `` zenith '' . Madhvacharya , the Dvaita Vedanta scholar interprets this term differently , and bases his theistic interpretation of Katha Upanishad by stating that the term refers to the deity Vishnu . This metaphorical parable of chariot is found in multiple ancient Indian texts , and is called the Ratha Kalpana . A similar simile is found in ancient Greek literature , such as the Parmenides , Xenophon 's prologue of Prodikos , and in the Platonic dialogue Phaedrus . The nature of Atman , need for ethics and the hierarchy of reality - third Valli ( edit ) The Katha Upanishad , in verses 1.3. 10 through 1.3. 12 presents a hierarchy of Reality from the perspective of a human being . It asserts that Artha ( objects , means of life ) are above Indriya ( senses ) , that Manas ( mind ) is above Artha in this hierarchy , above the Manas is Buddhi ( intellect , his ability to reason ) , above the Buddhi is Atman ( his Soul , great Self ) . Beyond the Atman , states Katha	Katha Upanishad
310	311	Upanishad , is the Avyaktam ( unmanifested Reality ) , and Purusha ( cosmic soul ) is beyond the Avyaktam , and beyond the Purusha , there is nothing - for it is the goal , for it is the highest road . At the basic level of life , the interaction is between Artha and Indriya ( sensory organs ) ; while at the highest level , man becomes aware of and holistically realizes the entire hierarchy . The Soul is hidden in all beings , asserts the Katha Upanishad ; it does not show itself , but its awareness is felt by seers with agrya sukshma ( subtle , more self - evident conscious , keen thinkers ) . In verse 1.3. 13 , Katha Upanishad states that Prajna ( conscious man ) should heed to the ethical precept of self - examination and self - restraint , restraining his speech and mind by the application of his Buddhi ( power to reason ) . Man should , asserts Katha Upanishad , holistically unify his tempered senses and mind with his intellect , all these with his Atman ( Soul , great Self ) , and unify his `` great Self '' with the Self of the rest , the tranquility of Oneness with the Avyaktam and `` cosmic soul '' . Self ( Atman ) is soundless , touchless , formless , tasteless , scentless , without beginning , without end , imperishable , beyond great ,	Katha Upanishad
311	312	blissful , and when one reveres one 's own Self , he is liberated . Such Self - realization is not easy according to Katha Upanishad , उत्तिष्ठत जाग्रत प्राप्य वरान्निबोधत । क्षुरस्य धारा निशिता दुरत्यया दुर्गं पथस्तत्कवयो वदन्ति ॥ १४ ॥ Rise , awake ! Having obtained these boons , understand them ! Like the Razor 's sharp edge is difficult to traverse , The path to one 's Self is difficult . -- Katha Upanishad , 1.3. 14 Paul Deussen states that verses 1.3. 10 to 1.3. 13 of Katha Upanishad is one of the earliest mentions of the elements of Yoga theory , and the recommendation of Yoga as a path to the highest goal of man , that is a life of spiritual freedom and liberation . This theory is significantly expanded upon in the second chapter of Katha Upanishad , particularly in the sixth Valli . The theory of Atman , oneness and plurality - fourth Valli ( edit ) The fourth Valli starts by asserting that inner knowledge is that of unity , eternal calmness and spiritual Oneness , while the external knowledge is that of plurality , perishable `` running around '' and sensory objects . The Katha Upanishad in fifteen verses of the fourth Valli , as well as those the fifth Valli , explains what is Atman , how it can be known , the nature of Atman , and why it ought to be known . For definition , it	Katha Upanishad
312	313	deploys an epistemic combination of `` positive assertions '' as well as `` exposition by elimination '' , the latter repeated with , किमत्र परिशिष्यते । एतद्वै तत् ॥ ४ ॥ What is left here ? Truly , this is that ( Atman ) . -- Katha Upanishad , 2.4. 3 Atman , asserts Katha Upanishad , is the subject of Self - knowledge , the bearer of spiritual reality , that which is all - prevading , inside every being , that unifies all human beings as well as all creatures , the concealed , eternal , immortal , pure bliss . It exists and active when man is in awake - state , it exists and active when man is in dream - state . The empirical reality is the `` honey '' for the Atman , with the honey metaphor repeating `` fruit of numerous karma flowers in the valley of life '' doctrine found in other Upanishads , such as in the second chapter of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad . To know Atman , look inward and introspect ; to know objects , look outward and examine , states Katha Upanishad . Everything that changes is not Atman , that which was , is , will be and never changes is Atman . Just like a baby is concealed inside a mother 's womb when conceived , Atman is concealed inside every creature , states verse 2.4. 8 of Katha Upanishad . Soul is the lord of the	Katha Upanishad
313	314	past , the lord of the now , and the lord of the future . Soul is eternal , never born , never dies , part of that which existed before the universe was formed from `` brooding heat '' . Sun rests in it , gods rest in it , all nature rests in it , it is everywhere , it is in everything . To understand the eternal nature of one 's Soul is to feel calmness , inner peace , patience and freedom regardless of the circumstances one is in , affections or threats one faces , praises or insults one is subjected to . Anyone who runs after sensory - impressions , gets lost among them just like water flows randomly after rainfall on mountains , state verses 2.4. 14 and 2.4. 15 of the Katha Upanishad ; and those who know their Soul and act according to its Dharma remain pure like pure water remains pure when poured into pure water . There is no plurality and separateness between the essence ( Atman ) of I and others , between the essence of nature and spirit , asserts Katha Upanishad in verses 2.4. 10 and 2.4. 11 . The soul - driven individual ignores the superficial individuality of others , and accepts their essential identity . Paul Deussen suggests that verses 2.4. 6 and 2.4. 7 posit a nondualistic ( Advaita ) position , where both Purusha and Prakrti are only Atman . This position	Katha Upanishad
314	315	contrasts with one of the fundamental premises of the dualistic schools of Hinduism . Shankara agrees with this interpretation . Ramanuja does n't and offers a theistic dualism based interpretation instead . Life is highest joy , and what happens after death - fifth Valli ( edit ) Katha Upanishad 's fifth Valli is an eschatological treatise . It begins by stating that human body is like a Pura ( Sanskrit : पुर , town , city ) with eleven gates that connect him to the universe . The individual , asserts Katha Upanishad , who understands and reveres this town of eternal , non-changing spirit , is never crooked - minded , is always free . The Soul dwells in swan , in atmosphere , in man , in Varasad ( wide spaces ) , in eternal law , everywhere in the universe ; it is born of water , it is born of kine , it is born of Ṛta ( right , truth , ethics , morals , eternal law ) , it is born of stone ( mountains ) as the great Ṛta , as ought to be . This Soul is worshipped by all the gods . Body dies , Soul does n't . In verses 2.5. 6 and 2.5. 7 , the Katha Upanishad discusses what happens to the soul after death , stating a variant of the premise of Karma theory that underlies major Indian religions , योनिमन्ये प्रपद्यन्ते शरीरत्वाय देहिनः । स्थाणुमन्येऽनुसंयन्ति	Katha Upanishad
315	316	यथाकर्म यथाश्रुतम् ॥ ७ ॥ Some of these souls enter into the womb , in order to embody again into organic beings , others assemble unto what is Sthānu ( immovable things ) , according to their karma , according to their shrutam ( श्रुतम् , knowledge , learning ) . -- Katha Upanishad , 2.5. 7 The Soul is always awake and active , while one is asleep , shaping wishful dreams . It is one with Brahman . It is everywhere , within and without , it is immortal . This universal , oneness theme is explained by the Katha Upanishad by three similes , which Paul Deussen calls as excellent . Just like one light exists and penetrates the cosmic space , enveloping and clinging to everything and every form individually , the `` one inner Self '' of beings exists and dwells in all beings , clings to every form and remains still without , states the Katha Upanishad . Just like one air exists and penetrates the world , enveloping and clinging to everything and every being individually , the `` one inner Self '' of beings exists and dwells in all beings , clings to every form and remains still without . Just like the Sun exists and its nature is not contaminated by the impurities seen by the eyes , the `` one inner Self '' of beings exists and its nature is pure , never contaminated by the sorrows and blemishes of	Katha Upanishad
316	317	the external world . Parts of the ideas in these first two similes of Katha Upanishad are of far more ancient origins , and found for example in Book 6 , Chapter 47 of Rig veda . That individual is perennially happy , asserts Katha Upanishad , who realizes the Atman is within him , that he himself is the Master , that the inner Self of all beings and his own Self are `` one form manifold '' , and none other . Life is spirit , full of joy . Meaning is Atman , full of perennial peace . `` Truly , this is that '' , once deeply felt and understood by man , is inexpressible highest joy . It is he who realizes this who shines , his splendour shines everything with and by ( Anu ) , the whole world shines by such joy unleashed , such splendour manifested . The theory of Yoga - sixth Valli ( edit ) The sixth Valli continues the discussion of Karma and rebirth theory , sections of which Max Muller states is possibly interpolated and inserted in a later period . The first five verses of the last section of the Upanishad assert that those who do not know or do not understand Atman return to the world of creation , and those who do are free , liberated . Some unaware of Brahman 's essence are naturally inclined to fear God and its manifestation such as nature	Katha Upanishad
317	318	( fire , lightning , sun ) , state verses 2.6. 2 and 2.6. 3 of Katha Upanishad . Those who are aware of Brahman 's essence , are awakened to the knowledge , fear no one and nothing , become immortal as with Brahman . The Katha Upanishad , in verses 2.6. 6 through 2.6. 13 recommends a path to Self - knowledge , and this path it calls Yoga . यदा पञ्चावतिष्ठन्ते ज्ञानानि मनसा सह । बुद्धिश्च न विचेष्टते तामाहुः परमां गतिम् ॥ १० ॥ तां योगमिति मन्यन्ते स्थिरामिन्द्रियधारणाम् । अप्रमत्तस्तदा भवति योगो हि प्रभवाप्ययौ ॥ ११ ॥ Only when Manas ( mind ) with thoughts and the five senses stand still , and when Buddhi ( intellect , power to reason ) does not waver , that they call the highest path . That is what one calls Yoga , the stillness of the senses , concentration of the mind , It is not thoughtless heedless sluggishness , Yoga is creation and dissolution . -- Katha Upanishad , 2.6. 10 - 11 Realize you are perfect now and here - sixth Valli ( edit ) The Katha Upanishad concludes its philosophical presentation in verses 14 - 15 of the sixth Valli . The state of perfection , according to the last section of the Upanishad , explains Paul Deussen , consists `` not in the attainment of a future or yonder world , but it is already just now and here for one who is Self -	Katha Upanishad
318	319	realized , who knows his Self ( Soul ) as Brahman ( Cosmic Soul ) '' . This teaching is also presented in the other ancient scriptures of Hinduism , such as Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 's Chapter 4.4. 6 . The verse 15 of the sixth Valli declares that the Upanishad concludes its teaching therein . Yet , the Valli contains three additional verses in modern era manuscripts . Scholars suggest that these remaining verses 2.6. 16 -- 2.6. 18 are possibly modern additions as appendix and have been interpolated , because of the declaration of Upanishad 's end in verse 15 , and because these additional three verses are structured in prose - like manner , rather than poetic metric - perfection of much of the Katha Upanishad . Reception ( edit ) Charles Johnston has called Katha Upanishad as one of the highest spiritual texts , with layers of metaphors embedded therein . To Johnston , the three nights and three boons in the first Valli of Katha Upanishad , for example , are among the text 's many layers , with the three connoting the past , the present and the future . The Irish poet William Butler Yeats dedicated several essays and sonnets to themes in Katha Upanishad and related ancient Upanishads of India . George William Russell similarly esteemed the Katha and other Upanishads . The American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson held Katha Upanishad highly , and wrote several poems and essays paralleling the themes in	Katha Upanishad
319	320	it . The various themes contained in Katha Upanishad have been subject of many scholarly works . For example , Elizabeth Schiltz has compared `` the parable of the chariot '' in Katha Upanishad and Platonic dialogue `` Phaedrus '' , noting the `` remarkable similarities give rise to a great many tantalizing historical and literary questions '' , and adding the comment , `` each provides an image of the self as the chariot , they each offer a complex moral psychology , and point toward an effective justification of the best life '' . Radhakrishnan notes that Katha Upanishad 's discussion of `` good versus pleasant '' is evidence of ethical theories and philosophical longings of ancient human beings in India by 1st millennium BCE , much like those in Greek city states in Europe . In popular Culture ( edit ) A verse in the Upanishad inspired the title and the epigraph of W. Somerset Maugham 's 1944 novel The Razor 's Edge , later adapted , twice , into films of the same title ( see articles on 1946 and 1984 films ) . The epigraph reads , `` The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over ; thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard . '' taken from a verse in the Katha - Upanishad -- 1.3. 14 . Maugham had visited India in 1938 and met Ramana Maharishi at his ashram in Tamil Nadu . See also (	Katha Upanishad

While some Upanishads have been deemed ' monistic ' , others , including the Katha Upanishad , are dualistic . Monism holds that reality is one -- Brahman -- and that all multiplicity ( matter , individual souls ) is ultimately reducible to that one reality . The Katha Upanishad , a relatively late text of the Black Yajurveda , is more complex . It teaches Brahman , like other Upanishads , but it also states that above the ' unmanifest ' ( Brahman ) stands Purusha , or ' Person ' . This claim originated in Samkhya ( analysis ) philosophy , which split all of reality into two coeternal principles : spirit ( purusha ) and primordial matrix ( prakriti ) .

340	341	Gold standard - Wikipedia Gold standard Jump to : navigation , search For other uses , see Gold standard ( disambiguation ) . Two golden 20 kr coins from the Scandinavian Monetary Union , which was based on a gold standard . The coin to the left is Swedish and the right one is Danish . Gold certificates were used as paper currency in the United States from 1882 to 1933 . These certificates were freely convertible into gold coins . Under a gold bullion standard , paper notes are convertible at a preset , fixed rate with gold bullion . A gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold . Three types can be distinguished : specie , bullion , and exchange . In the gold specie standard the monetary unit is associated with the value of circulating gold coins , or the monetary unit has the value of a certain circulating gold coin , but other coins may be made of less valuable metal . The gold bullion standard is a system in which gold coins do not circulate , but the authorities agree to sell gold bullion on demand at a fixed price in exchange for the circulating currency . The gold exchange standard usually does not involve the circulation of gold coins . The main feature of the gold exchange standard is that the government guarantees a fixed exchange rate to the	Gold standard
341	342	currency of another country that uses a gold standard ( specie or bullion ) , regardless of what type of notes or coins are used as a means of exchange . This creates a de facto gold standard , where the value of the means of exchange has a fixed external value in terms of gold that is independent of the inherent value of the means of exchange itself . Most nations abandoned the gold standard as the basis of their monetary systems at some point in the 20th century , although many hold substantial gold reserves . A survey of leading economists showed that they unanimously reject that a return to the gold standard would benefit the average American .

( July 2010 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) All references to `` dollars '' in this section refer to the United States dollar , unless otherwise stated . Origin The gold specie standard arose from the widespread acceptance of gold as currency . Various commodities have been used as money ; typically , the one that loses the least value over time becomes the accepted form . The use of gold as money began thousands of years ago in Asia Minor . During the early and high Middle Ages , the Byzantine gold solidus , commonly known as the bezant , was used widely throughout Europe and the Mediterranean . However , as the Byzantine Empire 's economic influence declined , so too did the use of the bezant . In its place , European territories chose silver as their currency over gold , leading to the development of silver standards . Silver pennies based on the Roman denarius became the staple coin of Mercia in Great Britain around the time of King Offa , circa CE 757 -- 796 . Similar coins , including Italian denari , French deniers , and Spanish dineros circulated in Europe . Spanish explorers discovered silver deposits in Mexico in 1522 and at Potosí in Bolivia in 1545 . International trade	Gold standard
343	344	came to depend on coins such as the Spanish dollar , the Maria Theresa thaler , and later , the United States trade dollar . In modern times , the British West Indies was one of the first regions to adopt a gold specie standard . Following Queen Anne 's proclamation of 1704 , the British West Indies gold standard was a de facto gold standard based on the Spanish gold doubloon . In 1717 , Sir Isaac Newton , the master of the Royal Mint , established a new mint ratio between silver and gold that had the effect of driving silver out of circulation and putting Britain on a gold standard . A formal gold specie standard was first established in 1821 , when Britain adopted it following the introduction of the gold sovereign by the new Royal Mint at Tower Hill in 1816 . The United Province of Canada in 1853 , Newfoundland in 1865 , and the United States and Germany ( de jure ) in 1873 adopted gold . The United States used the eagle as its unit , Germany introduced the new gold mark , while Canada adopted a dual system based on both the American gold eagle and the British gold sovereign . Australia and New Zealand adopted the British gold standard , as did the British West Indies , while Newfoundland was the only British Empire territory to introduce its own gold coin . Royal Mint branches were established in Sydney ,	Gold standard
344	345	Melbourne and Perth for the purpose of minting gold sovereigns from Australia 's rich gold deposits . The gold specie standard came to an end in the United Kingdom and the rest of the British Empire with the outbreak of World War I . Silver From 1750 to 1870 , wars within Europe as well as an ongoing trade deficit with China ( which sold to Europe but had little use for European goods ) drained silver from the economies of Western Europe and the United States . Coins were struck in smaller and smaller numbers , and there was a proliferation of bank and stock notes used as money . United Kingdom In the 1790s , the United Kingdom suffered a silver shortage . It ceased to mint larger silver coins and instead issued `` token '' silver coins and overstruck foreign coins . With the end of the Napoleonic Wars , the Bank of England began the massive recoinage programme that created standard gold sovereigns , circulating crowns , half - crowns and eventually copper farthings in 1821 . The recoinage of silver after a long drought produced a burst of coins . The United Kingdom struck nearly 40 million shillings between 1816 and 1820 , 17 million half crowns and 1.3 million silver crowns . The 1819 Act for the Resumption of Cash Payments set 1823 as the date for resumption of convertibility , which was reached by 1821 . Throughout the 1820s , small notes were	Gold standard
345	346	issued by regional banks . This was restricted in 1826 , while the Bank of England was allowed to set up regional branches . In 1833 however , Bank of England notes were made legal tender and redemption by other banks was discouraged . In 1844 , the Bank Charter Act established that Bank of England notes were fully backed by gold and they became the legal standard . According to the strict interpretation of the gold standard , this 1844 act marked the establishment of a full gold standard for British money . United States In the 1780s , Thomas Jefferson , Robert Morris and Alexander Hamilton recommended to Congress the value of a decimal system . This system would also apply to monies in the United States . The question was what type of standard : gold , silver or both . The United States adopted a silver standard based on the Spanish milled dollar in 1785 . International From 1860 to 1871 various attempts to resurrect bi-metallic standards were made , including one based on the gold and silver franc ; however , with the rapid influx of silver from new deposits , the expectation of scarce silver ended . The interaction between central banking and currency basis formed the primary source of monetary instability during this period . The combination of a restricted supply of notes , a government monopoly on note issuance and indirectly , a central bank and a single unit of value produced	Gold standard
346	347	economic stability . Deviation from these conditions produced monetary crises . Devalued notes or leaving silver as a store of value caused economic problems . Governments , demanding specie as payment , could drain the money out of the economy . Economic development expanded need for credit . The need for a solid basis in monetary affairs produced a rapid acceptance of the gold standard in the period that followed . Japan Following Germany 's decision after the 1870 -- 1871 Franco - Prussian War to extract reparations to facilitate a move to the gold standard , Japan gained the needed reserves after the Sino - Japanese War of 1894 -- 1895 . For Japan , moving to gold was considered vital for gaining access to Western capital markets . Bimetallic standard US : pre-civil War In 1792 , Congress passed the Mint and Coinage Act . It authorized the federal government 's use of the Bank of the United States to hold its reserves , as well as establish a fixed ratio of gold to the U.S. dollar . Gold and silver coins were legal tender , as was the Spanish real . In 1792 the market price of gold was about 15 times that of silver . Silver coins left circulation , exported to pay for the debts taken on to finance the American Revolutionary War . In 1806 President Jefferson suspended the minting of silver coins . This resulted in a derivative silver standard , since the	Gold standard
347	348	Bank of the United States was not required to fully back its currency with reserves . This began a long series of attempts by the United States to create a bi-metallic standard . The intention was to use gold for large denominations , and silver for smaller denominations . A problem with bimetallic standards was that the metals ' absolute and relative market prices changed . The mint ratio ( the rate at which the mint was obligated to pay / receive for gold relative to silver ) remained fixed at 15 ounces of silver to 1 ounce of gold , whereas the market rate fluctuated from 15.5 to 1 to 16 to 1 . With the Coinage Act of 1834 , Congress passed an act that changed the mint ratio to approximately 16 to 1 . Gold discoveries in California in 1848 and later in Australia lowered the gold price relative to silver ; this drove silver money from circulation because it was worth more in the market than as money . Passage of the Independent Treasury Act of 1848 placed the U.S. on a strict hard - money standard . Doing business with the American government required gold or silver coins . Government accounts were legally separated from the banking system . However , the mint ratio ( the fixed exchange rate between gold and silver at the mint ) continued to overvalue gold . In 1853 , the US reduced the silver weight of coins to keep	Gold standard
348	349	them in circulation and in 1857 removed legal tender status from foreign coinage . In 1857 the final crisis of the free banking era began as American banks suspended payment in silver , with ripples through the developing international financial system . Due to the inflationary finance measures undertaken to help pay for the US Civil War , the government found it difficult to pay its obligations in gold or silver and suspended payments of obligations not legally specified in specie ( gold bonds ) ; this led banks to suspend the conversion of bank liabilities ( bank notes and deposits ) into specie . In 1862 paper money was made legal tender . It was a fiat money ( not convertible on demand at a fixed rate into specie ) . These notes came to be called `` greenbacks '' . US : post-civil War After the Civil War , Congress wanted to reestablish the metallic standard at pre-war rates . The market price of gold in greenbacks was above the pre-War fixed price ( $20.67 per ounce of gold ) requiring deflation to achieve the pre-War price . This was accomplished by growing the stock of money less rapidly than real output . By 1879 the market price matched the mint price of gold . The coinage act of 1873 ( also known as the Crime of ' 73 ) demonetized silver . This act removed the 412.5 grain silver dollar from circulation . Subsequently silver was only	Gold standard
349	350	used in coins worth less than $1 ( fractional currency ) . With the resumption of convertibility on June 30 , 1879 the government again paid its debts in gold , accepted greenbacks for customs and redeemed greenbacks on demand in gold . Greenbacks were therefore perfect substitutes for gold coins . During the latter part of the nineteenth century the use of silver and a return to the bimetallic standard were recurrent political issues , raised especially by William Jennings Bryan , the People 's Party and the Free Silver movement . In 1900 the gold dollar was declared the standard unit of account and a gold reserve for government issued paper notes was established . Greenbacks , silver certificates , and silver dollars continued to be legal tender , all redeemable in gold . Fluctuations in the US gold stock , 1862 -- 1877 US gold stock 1862 59 tons 1866 81 tons 1875 50 tons 1878 78 tons The US had a gold stock of 1.9 million ounces ( 59 t ) in 1862 . Stocks rose to 2.6 million ounces ( 81 t ) in 1866 , declined in 1875 to 1.6 million ounces ( 50 t ) and rose to 2.5 million ounces ( 78 t ) in 1878 . Net exports did not mirror that pattern . In the decade before the Civil War net exports were roughly constant ; postwar they varied erratically around pre-war levels , but fell significantly in 1877 and	Gold standard
350	351	became negative in 1878 and 1879 . The net import of gold meant that the foreign demand for American currency to purchase goods , services , and investments exceeded the corresponding American demands for foreign currencies . In the final years of the greenback period ( 1862 -- 1879 ) , gold production increased while gold exports decreased . The decrease in gold exports was considered by some to be a result of changing monetary conditions . The demands for gold during this period were as a speculative vehicle , and for its primary use in the foreign exchange markets financing international trade . The major effect of the increase in gold demand by the public and Treasury was to reduce exports of gold and increase the Greenback price of gold relative to purchasing power .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( March 2013 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Towards the end of the 19th century , some silver standard countries began to peg their silver coin units to the gold standards of the United Kingdom or the United States . In 1898 , British India pegged the silver rupee to the pound sterling at a fixed rate of 1s 4d , while in 1906 , the Straits Settlements adopted a gold exchange standard against sterling ,	Gold standard
351	352	fixing the silver Straits dollar at 2s 4d . Around the start of the 20th century , the Philippines pegged the silver peso / dollar to the U.S. dollar at 50 cents . This move was assisted by the passage of the Philippines Coinage Act by the United States Congress on March 3 , 1903 . Around the same time Mexico and Japan pegged their currencies to the dollar . When Siam adopted a gold exchange standard in 1908 , only China and Hong Kong remained on the silver standard . When adopting the gold standard , many European nations changed the name of their currency , for instance from Daler ( Sweden and Denmark ) or Gulden ( Austria - Hungary ) to Crown , since the former names were traditionally associated with silver coins and the latter with gold coins . Impact of World War I Governments with insufficient tax revenue suspended convertibility repeatedly in the 19th century . The real test , however , came in the form of World War I , a test which `` it failed utterly '' according to economist Richard Lipsey . By the end of 1913 , the classical gold standard was at its peak but World War I caused many countries to suspend or abandon it . According to Lawrence Officer the main cause of the gold standard 's failure to resume its previous position after World War 1 was `` the Bank of England 's precarious liquidity position and	Gold standard
352	353	the gold - exchange standard . '' A run on sterling caused Britain to impose exchange controls that fatally weakened the standard ; convertibility was not legally suspended , but gold prices no longer played the role that they did before . In financing the war and abandoning gold , many of the belligerents suffered drastic inflations . Price levels doubled in the US and Britain , tripled in France and quadrupled in Italy . Exchange rates changed less , even though European inflations were more severe than America 's . This meant that the costs of American goods decreased relative to those in Europe . Between August 1914 and spring of 1915 , the dollar value of US exports tripled and its trade surplus exceeded $1 billion for the first time . Ultimately , the system could not deal quickly enough with the large balance of payments deficits and surpluses ; this was previously attributed to downward wage rigidity brought about by the advent of unionized labor , but is now considered as an inherent fault of the system that arose under the pressures of war and rapid technological change . In any case , prices had not reached equilibrium by the time of the Great Depression , which served to kill off the system completely . For example , Germany had gone off the gold standard in 1914 , and could not effectively return to it because War reparations had cost it much of its gold reserves .	Gold standard
353	354	During the Occupation of the Ruhr the German central bank ( Reichsbank ) issued enormous sums of non-convertible marks to support workers who were on strike against the French occupation and to buy foreign currency for reparations ; this led to the German hyperinflation of the early 1920s and the decimation of the German middle class . The US did not suspend the gold standard during the war . The newly created Federal Reserve intervened in currency markets and sold bonds to `` sterilize '' some of the gold imports that would have otherwise increased the stock of money . By 1927 many countries had returned to the gold standard . As a result of World War 1 the United States , which had been a net debtor country , had become a net creditor by 1919 . Gold bullion replaces gold specie as standard William McKinley ran for president on the basis of the gold standard . The gold specie standard ended in the United Kingdom and the rest of the British Empire at the outbreak of World War I , when Treasury notes replaced the circulation of gold sovereigns and gold half sovereigns . Legally , the gold specie standard was not repealed . The end of the gold standard was successfully effected by the Bank of England through appeals to patriotism urging citizens not to redeem paper money for gold specie . It was only in 1925 , when Britain returned to the gold standard in conjunction	Gold standard
354	355	with Australia and South Africa that the gold specie standard was officially ended . The British Gold Standard Act 1925 both introduced the gold bullion standard and simultaneously repealed the gold specie standard . The new standard ended the circulation of gold specie coins . Instead , the law compelled the authorities to sell gold bullion on demand at a fixed price , but `` only in the form of bars containing approximately four hundred ounces troy ( 12 kg ) of fine gold '' . John Maynard Keynes , citing deflationary dangers , argued against resumption of the gold standard . Many other countries followed Britain in returning to the gold standard , this was followed by a period of relative stability but also deflation . This state of affairs lasted until the Great Depression ( 1929 -- 1939 ) forced countries off the gold standard . In September 19 , 1931 , speculative attacks on the pound forced Britain to abandon the gold standard . Loans from American and French Central Banks of £ 50,000,000 were insufficient and exhausted in a matter of weeks , due to large gold outflows across the Atlantic . The British benefited from this departure . They could now use monetary policy to stimulate the economy . Australia and New Zealand had already left the standard and Canada quickly followed suit . The interwar partially backed gold standard was inherently unstable , because of the conflict between the expansion of liabilities to foreign	Gold standard
355	356	central banks and the resulting deterioration in the Bank of England 's reserve ratio . France was then attempting to make Paris a world class financial center , and it received large gold flows as well . In May 1931 a run on Austria 's largest commercial bank caused it to fail . The run spread to Germany , where the central bank also collapsed . International financial assistance was too late and in July 1931 Germany adopted exchange controls , followed by Austria in October . The Austrian and German experiences , as well as British budgetary and political difficulties , were among the factors that destroyed confidence in sterling , which occurred in mid-July 1931 . Runs ensued and the Bank of England lost much of its reserves . Depression and World War ii Ending the gold standard and economic recovery during the Great Depression . Great Depression Some economic historians , such as Barry Eichengreen , blame the gold standard of the 1920s for prolonging the economic depression which started in 1929 and lasted for about a decade . In the United States , adherence to the gold standard prevented the Federal Reserve from expanding the money supply to stimulate the economy , fund insolvent banks and fund government deficits that could `` prime the pump '' for an expansion . Once off the gold standard , it became free to engage in such money creation . The gold standard limited the flexibility of the central banks	Gold standard
356	357	' monetary policy by limiting their ability to expand the money supply . In the US , the central bank was required by the Federal Reserve Act ( 1913 ) to have gold backing 40 % of its demand notes . Others including former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Nobel Prize - winner Milton Friedman place the blame for the severity and length of the Great Depression at the feet of the Federal Reserve , mostly due to the deliberate tightening of monetary policy even after the gold standard . They blamed the US major economic contraction in 1937 on tightening of monetary policy resulting in higher cost of capital , weaker securities markets , reduced net government contribution to income , the undistributed profits tax and higher labor costs . The money supply peaked in March 1937 , with a trough in May 1938 . Higher interest rates intensified the deflationary pressure on the dollar and reduced investment in U.S. banks . Commercial banks converted Federal Reserve Notes to gold in 1931 , reducing its gold reserves and forcing a corresponding reduction in the amount of currency in circulation . This speculative attack created a panic in the U.S. banking system . Fearing imminent devaluation many depositors withdrew funds from U.S. banks . As bank runs grew , a reverse multiplier effect caused a contraction in the money supply . Additionally the New York Fed had loaned over $150 million in gold ( over 240 tons ) to	Gold standard
357	358	European Central Banks . This transfer contracted the US money supply . The foreign loans became questionable once Britain , Germany , Austria and other European countries went off the gold standard in 1931 and weakened confidence in the dollar . The forced contraction of the money supply resulted in deflation . Even as nominal interest rates dropped , inflation - adjusted real interest rates remained high , rewarding those who held onto money instead of spending it , further slowing the economy . Recovery in the United States was slower than in Britain , in part due to Congressional reluctance to abandon the gold standard and float the U.S. currency as Britain had done . In the early 1930s , the Federal Reserve defended the dollar by raising interest rates , trying to increase the demand for dollars . This helped attract international investors who bought foreign assets with gold . Congress passed the Gold Reserve Act on 30 January 1934 ; the measure nationalized all gold by ordering Federal Reserve banks to turn over their supply to the U.S. Treasury . In return the banks received gold certificates to be used as reserves against deposits and Federal Reserve notes . The act also authorized the president to devalue the gold dollar . Under this authority the president , on 31 January 1934 , changed the value of the dollar from $20.67 to the troy ounce to $35 to the troy ounce , a devaluation of over 40 %	Gold standard
358	359	. Other factors in the prolongation of the Great Depression include trade wars and the reduction in international trade caused by barriers such as Smoot -- Hawley Tariff in the US and the Imperial Preference policies of Great Britain , the failure of central banks to act responsibly , government policies designed to prevent wages from falling , such as the Davis -- Bacon Act of 1931 , during the deflationary period resulting in production costs dropping slower than sales prices , thereby injuring business profits and increases in taxes to reduce budget deficits and to support new programs such as Social Security . The US top marginal income tax rate went from 25 % to 63 % in 1932 and to 79 % in 1936 , while the bottom rate increased over tenfold , from . 375 % in 1929 to 4 % in 1932 . The concurrent massive drought resulted in the US Dust Bowl . The Austrian School asserted that the Great Depression was the result of a credit bust . Alan Greenspan wrote that the bank failures of the 1930s were sparked by Great Britain dropping the gold standard in 1931 . This act `` tore asunder '' any remaining confidence in the banking system . Financial historian Niall Ferguson wrote that what made the Great Depression truly ' great ' was the European banking crisis of 1931 . According to Fed Chairman Marriner Eccles , the root cause was the concentration of wealth resulting in	Gold standard
359	360	a stagnating or decreasing standard of living for the poor and middle class . These classes went into debt , producing the credit explosion of the 1920s . Eventually the debt load grew too heavy , resulting in the massive defaults and financial panics of the 1930s . World War ii Under the Bretton Woods international monetary agreement of 1944 , the gold standard was kept without domestic convertibility . The role of gold was severely constrained , as other countries ' currencies were fixed in terms of the dollar . Many countries kept reserves in gold and settled accounts in gold . Still they preferred to settle balances with other currencies , with the American dollar becoming the favorite . The International Monetary Fund was established to help with the exchange process and assist nations in maintaining fixed rates . Within Bretton Woods adjustment was cushioned through credits that helped countries avoid deflation . Under the old standard , a country with an overvalued currency would lose gold and experience deflation until the currency was again valued correctly . Most countries defined their currencies in terms of dollars , but some countries imposed trading restrictions to protect reserves and exchange rates . Therefore , most countries ' currencies were still basically inconvertible . In the late 1950s , the exchange restrictions were dropped and gold became an important element in international financial settlements .

( October 2013 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Main article : Bretton Woods system After the Second World War , a system similar to a gold standard and sometimes described as a `` gold exchange standard '' was established by the Bretton Woods Agreements . Under this system , many countries fixed their exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar and central banks could exchange dollar holdings into gold at the official exchange rate of $35 per ounce ; this option was not available to firms or individuals . All currencies pegged to the dollar thereby had a fixed value in terms of gold . Starting in the 1959 -- 1969 administration of President Charles de Gaulle and continuing until 1970 , France reduced its dollar reserves , exchanging them for gold at the official exchange rate , reducing US economic influence . This , along with the fiscal strain of federal expenditures for the Vietnam War and persistent balance of payments deficits , led U.S. President Richard Nixon to end international convertibility of the U.S. dollar to gold on August 15 , 1971 ( the `` Nixon Shock '' ) . This was meant to be a temporary measure , with the gold price of the dollar and the official rate of exchanges remaining constant . Revaluing currencies was the main purpose of this plan . No	Gold standard
361	362	official revaluation or redemption occurred . The dollar subsequently floated . In December 1971 , the `` Smithsonian Agreement '' was reached . In this agreement , the dollar was devalued from $35 per troy ounce of gold to $38 . Other countries ' currencies appreciated . However , gold convertibility did not resume . In October 1973 , the price was raised to $42.22 . Once again , the devaluation was insufficient . Within two weeks of the second devaluation the dollar was left to float . The $42.22 par value was made official in September 1973 , long after it had been abandoned in practice . In October 1976 , the government officially changed the definition of the dollar ; references to gold were removed from statutes . From this point , the international monetary system was made of pure fiat money . Production of gold An estimated total of 174,100 tonnes of gold have been mined in human history , according to GFMS as of 2012 . This is roughly equivalent to 5.6 billion troy ounces or , in terms of volume , about 9,261 cubic metres ( 327,000 cu ft ) , or a cube 21 metres ( 69 ft ) on a side . There are varying estimates of the total volume of gold mined . One reason for the variance is that gold has been mined for thousands of years . Another reason is that some nations are not particularly open about how much	Gold standard
362	363	gold is being mined . In addition , it is difficult to account for the gold output in illegal mining activities . World production for 2011 was at 2,700 tonnes . Since the 1950s , annual gold output growth has approximately kept pace with world population growth of around 2x , although far less than world economic growth of some 8x , or some 4x since 1980 . Theory This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( May 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Commodity money is inconvenient to store and transport in large amounts . Furthermore , it does not allow a government to manipulate the flow of commerce with the same ease that a fiat currency does . As such , commodity money gave way to representative money and gold and other specie were retained as its backing . Gold was a preferred form of money due to its rarity , durability , divisibility , fungibility and ease of identification , often in conjunction with silver . Silver was typically the main circulating medium , with gold as the monetary reserve . Commodity money was anonymous , as identifying marks can be removed . Commodity money retains its value despite what may happen to the monetary authority . After the fall of South Vietnam , many refugees carried their wealth	Gold standard
363	364	to the West in gold after the national currency became worthless . Under commodity standards currency itself has no intrinsic value , but is accepted by traders because it can be redeemed any time for the equivalent specie . A US silver certificate , for example , could be redeemed for an actual piece of silver . Representative money and the gold standard protect citizens from hyperinflation and other abuses of monetary policy , as were seen in some countries during the Great Depression . Commodity money conversely led to deflation and bank runs . Countries that left the gold standard earlier than other countries recovered from the Great Depression sooner . For example , Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries , which left the gold standard in 1931 , recovered much earlier than France and Belgium , which remained on gold much longer . Countries such as China , which had a silver standard , almost entirely avoided the depression ( due to the fact it was then barely integrated into the global economy ) . The connection between leaving the gold standard and the severity and duration of the depression was consistent for dozens of countries , including developing countries . This may explain why the experience and length of the depression differed between national economies . Variations A full or 100 % - reserve gold standard exists when the monetary authority holds sufficient gold to convert all the circulating representative money into gold at the promised exchange	Gold standard
364	365	rate . It is sometimes referred to as the gold specie standard to more easily distinguish it . Opponents of a full standard consider it difficult to implement , saying that the quantity of gold in the world is too small to sustain worldwide economic activity at or near current gold prices ; implementation would entail a many-fold increase in the price of gold . Gold standard proponents have said , `` Once a money is established , any stock of money becomes compatible with any amount of employment and real income . '' While prices would necessarily adjust to the supply of gold , the process may involve considerable economic disruption , as was experienced during earlier attempts to maintain gold standards . In an international gold - standard system ( which is necessarily based on an internal gold standard in the countries concerned ) , gold or a currency that is convertible into gold at a fixed price is used to make international payments . Under such a system , when exchange rates rise above or fall below the fixed mint rate by more than the cost of shipping gold , inflows or outflows occur until rates return to the official level . International gold standards often limit which entities have the right to redeem currency for gold . Advantages Long - term price stability has been described as one of the virtues of the gold standard . The gold standard makes it difficult for governments to inflate	Gold standard
365	366	prices through expanding the money supply . Under the gold standard , significant inflation is rare , and hyperinflation is essentially impossible because the money supply can only grow at the rate that the gold supply increases . High inflation under a gold standard is seen only when warfare destroys a large part of an economy , reducing the production of goods , or when a major new gold source becomes available . In the U.S. , inflation occurred during the Civil War , which destroyed the economy of the South . Inflation also followed the California Gold Rush that made large amounts of gold available for minting . Historical data shows that the magnitude of short run swings in prices were far higher under the gold standard . The gold standard provides fixed international exchange rates between participating countries and thus reduces uncertainty in international trade . Historically , imbalances between price levels were offset by a balance - of - payment adjustment mechanism called the `` price -- specie flow mechanism '' . Gold used to pay for imports reduces the money supply of importing nations , causing deflation , which makes them more competitive , while the importation of gold by net exporters serves to increase their money supply , causing inflation , making them less competitive . A gold standard does not allow some types of financial repression . Financial repression acts as a mechanism to transfer wealth from creditors to debtors , particularly the governments	Gold standard
366	367	that practice it . Financial repression is most successful in reducing debt when accompanied by inflation and can be considered a form of taxation . In 1966 Alan Greenspan wrote `` Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth . Gold stands in the way of this insidious process . It stands as a protector of property rights . If one grasps this , one has no difficulty in understanding the statists ' antagonism toward the gold standard . '' Disadvantages Gold prices ( US $ per troy ounce ) from 1914 , in nominal US $ and inflation adjusted US $ . The unequal distribution of gold deposits makes the gold standard more advantageous for those countries that produce gold . In 2010 the largest producers of gold , in order , were China , Australia , U.S. , South Africa and Russia . The country with the largest unmined gold deposits is Australia . Some economists believe that the gold standard acts as a limit on economic growth . `` As an economy 's productive capacity grows , then so should its money supply . Because a gold standard requires that money be backed in the metal , then the scarcity of the metal constrains the ability of the economy to produce more capital and grow . '' Mainstream economists believe that economic recessions can be largely mitigated by increasing the money supply during economic downturns . A gold standard means that the money supply	Gold standard
367	368	would be determined by the gold supply and hence monetary policy could no longer be used to stabilize the economy . The gold standard is often blamed for prolonging the Great Depression , as under the gold standard , central banks could not expand credit at a fast enough rate to offset deflationary forces . Although the gold standard brings long - run price stability , it is historically associated with high short - run price volatility . It has been argued by Schwartz , among others , that instability in short - term price levels can lead to financial instability as lenders and borrowers become uncertain about the value of debt . Deflation punishes debtors . Real debt burdens therefore rise , causing borrowers to cut spending to service their debts or to default . Lenders become wealthier , but may choose to save some of the additional wealth , reducing GDP . The money supply would essentially be determined by the rate of gold production . When gold stocks increase more rapidly than the economy , there is inflation and the reverse is also true . The consensus view is that the gold standard contributed to the severity and length of the Great Depression . Hamilton contended that the gold standard is susceptible to speculative attacks when a government 's financial position appears weak . Conversely , this threat discourages governments from engaging in risky policy ( see moral hazard ) . For example , the U.S. was	Gold standard
368	369	forced to contract the money supply and raise interest rates in September 1931 to defend the dollar after speculators forced the UK off the gold standard . Devaluing a currency under a gold standard would generally produce sharper changes than the smooth declines seen in fiat currencies , depending on the method of devaluation . Most economists favor a low , positive rate of inflation of around 2 % . This reflects fear of deflationary shocks and the belief that active monetary policy can dampen fluctuations in output and unemployment . Inflation gives them room to tighten policy without inducing deflation . A gold standard provides practical constraints against the measures that central banks might otherwise use to respond to economic crises . Creation of new money reduces interest rates and thereby increases demand for new lower cost debt , raising the demand for money . Gold standard and Bitcoin Bitcoin in grams of gold According to research produced by the Bank of Canada , the emerging Bitcoin economy has many similarities with the economy based on gold standard , in particular : limited and predictable supply of the anchor of the monetary system no central bank or monetary authority controls the supply low or non-existent inflation virtually no arbitrage costs for international transactions Governments have less control over their domestic economies Governments lose seigniorage revenues that they obtain from the ability to almost costlessly create money Edward Hadas and Michael Hiltzik noted that monetary systems based on Bitcoin and	Gold standard
369	370	gold have some similar disadvantages : independence from government price declines less spending during crisis times George Gilder , a proponent of gold standard , proposed breaking `` the government monopoly on money '' by using a combination of Bitcoin for the internet and treating gold in tax terms as currency . Advocates A return to the gold standard was considered by the US Gold Commission back in 1982 , but found only minority support . In 2001 Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad proposed a new currency that would be used initially for international trade among Muslim nations , using the Islamic gold dinar , defined as 4.25 grams of pure ( 24 - carat ) gold . Mahathir claimed it would be a stable unit of account and a political symbol of unity between Islamic nations . This would purportedly reduce dependence on the US dollar and establish a non-debt - backed currency in accord with Sharia law that prohibited the charging of interest . As of 2013 the global monetary system continued to rely on the US dollar as the main reserve currency . Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman , Alan Greenspan acknowledged he was one of `` a small minority '' within the central bank that had some positive view on the gold standard . In a 1966 essay he contributed to a book by Ayn Rand , titled `` Gold and Economic Freedom '' , Greenspan argued the case for returning to a ' pure	Gold standard
370	371	' gold standard ; in that essay he described supporters of fiat currencies as `` welfare statists '' intending to use monetary policy to finance deficit spending . More recently he claimed that by focusing on targeting inflation `` central bankers have behaved as though we were on the gold standard '' , rendering a return to the standard unnecessary . Similarly , economists like Robert Barro argued that whilst some form of `` monetary constitution '' is essential for stable , depoliticized monetary policy , the form this constitution takes -- for example , a gold standard , some other commodity - based standard , or a fiat currency with fixed rules for determining the quantity of money -- is considerably less important . The gold standard is supported by many followers of the Austrian School of Economics , free - market libertarians and some supply - siders . US Politics In the United States , strict constitutionalists object to the government issuing fiat currency through central banks . Some gold - standard advocates also call for a mandated end to fractional - reserve banking . Many similar alternatives have been suggested , including energy - based currencies , collections of currencies or commodities , with gold as one component . Former congressman Ron Paul is a long - term , high - profile advocate of a gold standard , but has also expressed support for using a standard based on a basket of commodities that better reflects the	Gold standard
371	372	state of the economy . In 2011 the Utah legislature passed a bill to accept federally issued gold and silver coins as legal tender to pay taxes . As federally issued currency , the coins were already legal tender for taxes , although the market price of their metal content currently exceeds their monetary value . Similar legislation is under consideration in other US states . The bill was initiated by newly elected Republican Party legislators associated with the Tea Party movement and was driven by anxiety over the policies of President Barack Obama . In 2013 , the Arizona Legislature passed SB 1439 , which would have made gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debt , but the bill was vetoed by the Governor . In 2015 , some candidates for the 2016 presidential election advocated for a gold standard , based on concern that the Federal Reserve 's attempts to increase economic growth may create inflation . Economic historians did not agree with candidate 's assertions that the gold standard would benefit the US economy . Critics In 2012 a poll of 40 U.S. economists in the IGM Economic Experts Panel found that none of them agreed with a claim that a return to the gold standard would result in `` price - stability and employment outcomes ( that ) would be better for the average American . '' The panel of polled economists included past Nobel Prize winners , former economic advisers to	Gold standard
372	373	both Republican and Democratic presidents , and senior faculty from Harvard , Chicago , Stanford , MIT , and other well - known research universities . ( The specific question posed to the economists was : `` If the US replaced its discretionary monetary policy regime with a gold standard , defining a ' dollar ' as a specific number of ounces of gold , the price - stability and employment outcomes would be better for the average American . '' ) The economist Allan H. Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University presented arguments against Ron Paul 's advocacy of the gold standard since the 1970s . He sometimes summarizes his opposition by stating simply , `` ( W ) e do n't have the gold standard . It 's not because we do n't know about the gold standard , it 's because we do .

Unitarian Universalism ( UU ) is a liberal religion characterized by a `` free and responsible search for truth and meaning '' . Unitarian Universalists assert no creed , but instead are unified by their shared search for spiritual growth . As such , their congregations include many atheists , agnostics , and theists within their membership . The roots of Unitarian Universalism lie in liberal Christianity , specifically Unitarianism and Universalism . Unitarian	Unitarian Universalism
427	428	Universalists state that from these traditions comes a deep regard for intellectual freedom and inclusive love . Congregations and members seek inspiration and derive insight from all major world religions . The beliefs of individual Unitarian Universalists range widely , including atheism , agnosticism , pantheism , deism , Judaism , Islam , Christianity , neopaganism , Hinduism , Buddhism , Daoism , Humanism , and many more . The Unitarian Universalist Association ( UUA ) was formed in 1961 through the consolidation of the American Unitarian Association , established in 1825 , and the Universalist Church of America , established in 1793 . The UUA is headquartered in Boston , Massachusetts , and serves churches mostly in the United States . A group of thirty Philippine congregations is represented as a sole member within the UUA . The Canadian Unitarian Council ( CUC ) became an independent body in 2002 . The UUA and CUC are , in turn , two of the seventeen members of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists .

At the time of the North American consolidation , Unitarians and Universalists had expanded beyond their roots in liberal Christian theology . Today they draw from a variety of religious traditions . Individuals may or may not self - identify as Christians or subscribe to Christian beliefs . Unitarian Universalist congregations and fellowships tend to retain some Christian traditions , such as Sunday worship with a sermon and the singing of hymns	Unitarian Universalism
430	431	. The extent to which the elements of any particular faith tradition are incorporated into personal spiritual practice is a matter of individual choice for congregants , in keeping with a creedless , non-dogmatic approach to spirituality and faith development . New England Unitarians evolved from the Pilgrim Fathers ' Congregational Christianity , which was originally based on a literal reading of the Holy Bible . Liberalizing Unitarians rejected the Trinitarian belief in the tri-personal godhead : Father , Son , and Holy Ghost / Spirit . Instead , they asserted a unitary notion of God . In addition , they rejected the doctrine of original sin , moving away from the Calvinism of the Congregationalists . New England Universalists rejected the Puritan forefathers ' emphasis on the select few , the Elect , who were supposed to be saved from eternal damnation by a just God . Instead Universalists asserted that all people will eventually be reconciled with God . Universalists rejected the hellfire and damnation of the evangelical preachers , who tried to revive the fundamentalist Christianity of the early Pilgrim fathers . Universalism ( edit ) Main articles : Universalism and Christian Universalism Universalists claim a long history , beginning with Origen and Gregory of Nyssa , though some modern scholars question whether either of these church fathers taught the defining doctrine of Universalism ( universal salvation ) . This core doctrine asserts that through Christ every single human soul shall be saved , leading to the	Unitarian Universalism
431	432	`` restitution of all things '' ( apocatastasis ) . In 1793 , Universalism emerged as a particular denomination of Christianity in the United States , eventually called the Universalist Church of America . Early American advocates of Universal Salvation such as Elhanan Winchester , Hosea Ballou and John Murray taught that all souls would achieve salvation , sometimes after a period resembling purgatory . Christian Universalism denies the doctrine of everlasting damnation , and proclaims belief in an entirely loving God who will ultimately redeem all human beings . Unitarianism ( edit ) Main article : Unitarianism Historically , various forms of Nontrinitarianism have appeared within Christianity . The term may refer to any belief about the nature of Jesus Christ that affirms God as a singular entity and rejects the doctrine of the Trinity , as affirmed by the mainstream Christianity : a consensus of Christian bishops at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 . Nontrinitarianism was especially prevalent during the theological turmoils of the Protestant Reformation . A Spanish physician , Michael Servetus , studied the Bible and concluded that the concept of the Trinity , as traditionally conceived , was not biblical . His books On the Errors of the Trinity and Christianismi Restitutio caused much uproar . Servetus was eventually arrested , convicted of heresy , and burned at the stake in Geneva in 1553 under the order of John Calvin . The term Unitarian entered the English language via Henry Hedworth , who	Unitarian Universalism
432	433	applied it to the teachings of Laelio Sozzini and the Polish Socinians . Unitarian churches were formally established in Transylvania and Poland ( by the Socinians ) in the second half of the 16th Century . There , the first doctrines of religious freedom in Europe were established ( in the course of several diets between 1557 and 1568 , see Edict of Torda ) under the jurisdiction of John Sigismund , king of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania , the only Unitarian monarch . The early Unitarian church not only rejected the Trinity , but also the pre-existence of Christ as well as , in many cases , predestination and original sin as put forward by Augustine of Hippo , and the substitutionary atonement of Christ developed by Anselm of Canterbury and John Calvin . There were several different forms of Christology in the beginnings of the Unitarian movement ; ultimately , the dominant Christology became psilanthropism : that Jesus was a man , but one with a unique relationship to God . Britain ( edit ) Main article : History of Unitarianism Influenced by the teachings of the Polish Socinians , Samuel Clarke ( 1675 -- 1729 ) revised the Book of Common Prayer , removing the Trinitarian Nicene Creed and references to Jesus as God . Theophilus Lindsey also revised the Book of Common Prayer to allow a more tolerant , free Unitarian interpretation . Neither cleric was charged under the Blasphemy Act 1697 that made it	Unitarian Universalism
433	434	an offense for any person , educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion , by writing , preaching , teaching or advised speaking , to deny the Holy Trinity . The Act of Toleration ( 1689 ) gave relief to English Dissenters , but excluded Unitarians . The efforts of Clarke and Lindsey met with substantial criticism from the more conservative clergy and laity of the Church of England . In response , in 1774 , Lindsey applied for registration of the Essex House as a Dissenting place of worship with the assistance of barrister John Lee . On the Sunday following the registration -- April 17 , 1774 -- the first true Unitarian congregation discreetly convened in the provisional Essex Street Chapel . In attendance were Lee , Joseph Priestley and the agent of the Massachusetts Colony , Benjamin Franklin . Priestley also founded a reform congregation , but , after his home was burned down in the Priestley Riots , fled with his wife to America , where he became a leading figure in the founding of the church on American soil . Once laity and clergy relaxed their vehement opposition to the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813 , which finally allowed for protections of dissenting religions , the British and Foreign Unitarian Association was founded in 1825 . It has its headquarters in Essex Hall , successor to Lindsey 's Essex House . Two that have been significant in national life are the	Unitarian Universalism
434	435	Cross Street Chapel in Manchester and , Newington Green Unitarian Church in north London . Unitarian congregations in Britain today meet under the auspices of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches . There are 170 communities of Unitarians across Britain . United States ( edit ) Main article : History of Unitarianism In the United States , the Unitarian movement began primarily in the Congregational parish churches of New England , which were part of the state church of Massachusetts . These churches , whose buildings may still be seen today in many New England town squares , trace their roots to the division of the Puritan colonies into parishes for the administration of their religious needs . In the late 18th century , conflict grew within some of these churches between Unitarian and Trinitarian factions . In 1805 , Unitarians gained key faculty positions at Harvard . In 1819 William Ellery Channing preached the ordination sermon for Jared Sparks in Baltimore , outlining the Unitarian position . The American Unitarian Association was founded as a separate denomination in 1825 . By coincidence and unknown to both parties , the AUA was formed on the same day -- May 26 , 1825 -- as the British and Foreign Unitarian Association In the 19th century , under the influence of Ralph Waldo Emerson ( who had been a Unitarian minister ) and other transcendentalists , Unitarianism began its long journey from liberal Protestantism to its present more pluralist	Unitarian Universalism
435	436	form . Integration 1825 -- 1961 ( edit ) After the schism in the Congregational Churches resulting in the foundation of the American Unitarian Association , some of those churches remained within the Congregational fold and became member congregations of the Congregational organization ( later the United Church of Christ ) , while others voted to become Unitarian . Some of the latter eventually became part of the UUA during a consolidation of the Unitarian and Universalist churches . Universalist churches in contrast followed a different path , having begun as independent congregations beyond the bounds of the established Puritan churches entirely . Today , the UUA and the United Church of Christ cooperate jointly on social justice initiatives such as the Sexuality Education Advocacy Training project . In 1961 , the American Unitarian Association ( AUA ) was consolidated with the Universalist Church of America ( UCA ) , thus forming the Unitarian Universalist Association . In the same year , the Canadian Unitarian Council ( CUC ) formed . The Unitarian Universalist Association ( UUA ) was also given corporate status in May 1961 under special acts of legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New York . In 1998 , the Canadian Unitarian Council and Unitarian Universalist Association dissolved their financial accord , although they continue to cooperate . The CUC had come into being at Meadville in 1961 . However the continual decline of denominational churches and almost complete failure of the Universalist	Unitarian Universalism
436	437	movement in Canada , had caused the creation of the Council to prompt a plan to merge with the UUA . Opposition to Liberal religious freedom relaxed , so that by 2002 it was agreed to increase autonomy and funding . The amalgamation proved troublesome for the Canadians , in a small minority , and largely ignored with only 45 congregations and 5,200 members , the Americans were insensitive to cultural differences . Belief , covenant , and scripture ( edit ) Unitarian Universalists practice a non-creedal religion . Consequently , their individual beliefs are diverse , and their attitude toward each other 's beliefs and traditions is one of tolerance and acceptance . Rather than a focus on doctrine or belief , Unitarian Universalists find primary significance in their shared agreement , or covenant : member congregations agree to `` affirm and promote '' the Seven Principles . Rather than honoring a narrow religious tradition , Unitarian Universalists embrace a `` living tradition '' drawn from a multitude of sources , including the Six Sources . Seven Principles ( edit ) Main article : Unitarian Universalist Association § Principles and purposes Adopted in 1960 , the Principles , Purposes and Sources can be found in the Bylaws of the Unitarian Universalist Association . The Principles are expressed , We , the member congregations of the Unitarian Universalist Association , covenant to affirm and promote : The inherent worth and dignity of every person ; Justice , equity and compassion	Unitarian Universalism
437	438	in human relations ; Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations ; A free and responsible search for truth and meaning ; The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large ; The goal of world community with peace , liberty , and justice for all ; Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part . Six sources ( edit ) Unitarian Universalists place emphasis on spiritual growth and development . The official statement of Unitarian Universalist principles describes the `` sources '' upon which current practice is based : Direct experience of that transcending mystery and wonder , affirmed in all cultures , which moves us to a renewal of the spirit and an openness to the forces which create and uphold life ; Words and deeds of prophetic women and men which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice , compassion , and the transforming power of love ; Wisdom from the world 's religions which inspires us in our ethical and spiritual life ; Jewish and Christian teachings which call us to respond to God 's love by loving our neighbors as ourselves ; Humanist teachings which counsel us to heed the guidance of reason and the results of science , and warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit . Spiritual teachings of earth - centered traditions which celebrate the	Unitarian Universalism
438	439	sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature . Unitarian Universalist principles and purposes have been modified over time to manifest a broader acceptance of beliefs and traditions among the membership . The seventh Principle ( adopted in 1985 ) , `` Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part '' , and a sixth Source ( adopted in 1995 ) , `` Spiritual teachings of earth - centered traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature '' were added to explicitly include members with neopagan , Native American , and pantheist spiritualities . Approach to sacred writings ( edit ) Both Unitarianism and Universalism were originally Christian denominations ; they still reference Jewish and Christian texts . Today , the Unitarian Universalist approach to the Christian Bible , Hebrew Scriptures , and other sacred works is presented by the UUA : While Unitarianism and Universalism both have roots in the Protestant Christian tradition , where the Bible is the sacred text , we now look to additional sources for religious and moral inspiration ... . We celebrate the spiritual insights of the world 's religions , recognizing wisdom in many scriptures . When we read scripture in worship , whether it is the Bible , the Dhammapada , or the Tao Te - Ching , we interpret it as a product of its	Unitarian Universalism
439	440	time and its place , ... not to be interpreted narrowly or oppressively ... ( S ) cripture is never the only word , or the final word . From the beginning we have trusted in the human capacity to use reason and draw conclusions about religion ... ( E ) ach of us ultimately chooses what is sacred to us . In short , Unitarian Universalists regard the texts of the world 's religions as works of people , worthy of respect , with the intention that people from all religions or spiritual backgrounds live peaceably with one another . Worship and practice ( edit ) This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( June 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Diversity of practices ( edit ) The Unitarian belief that reason , and not creed , defines the search for truth , and the Universalist belief that God embraces all people equally has led to the current Unitarian Universalist belief that truth and spiritual meaning can be found in all faiths . This is reflected in the wide array of spiritual practices found among Unitarian Universalists today . Many Unitarian Universalist congregations include Buddhist - style meditation groups , Jewish Seder , Yom Kippur and Passover dinners , iftaar meals ( marking the breaking of Ramadan fast for Muslims )	Unitarian Universalism
440	441	, and Christmas Eve / Winter Solstice services . Children 's and youth 's religious education classes teach about the divinity of the world and the sanctity of world religions . One of its more popular curricula , Neighboring Faiths ( formerly Church Across the Street ) , takes middle and high school participants to visit the places of worship of many faith traditions including a Hindu temple , a Reform or Orthodox synagogue , and a Catholic church . There is great variety among Unitarian Universalist congregations , with some favoring particular religious beliefs or forms of worship over others , with many more home to an eclectic mix of beliefs . Regardless of their orientation , most congregations are fairly open to differing beliefs , though not always with various faith traditions represented to the same degree . Diversity of congregations ( edit ) There is a wide variety in how congregations conceive of themselves , calling themselves `` churches '' , `` societies '' , `` fellowships '' , `` congregations '' , or eschew the use of any particular descriptor ( e.g. `` Unitarian Universalists of San Mateo '' ) . Whether a congregation is a ' fellowship ' or a ' church ' sometimes hinges on whether it is led by one ( or more ) minister ( s ) : those without ministers being fellowships , those with ministers being churches . Many use the name `` Unitarian Universalist '' , ( and a	Unitarian Universalism
441	442	few `` Universalist Unitarian '' ) , having gradually adopted this formulation since consolidation in 1961 . Others use names that reflect their historic roots by keeping the historical designation `` Unitarian '' or `` Universalist '' ( e.g. `` First Unitarian Church '' ) . A few congregations use neither ( e.g. Unity Temple ) . For some congregations , the name can be a clue to their theological orientation . For others , avoidance of the word `` church '' indicates a desire to distance itself from traditional Christian theology . Sometimes the use of another term may simply indicate a congregation 's lay - led or relatively new status . However , some Unitarian Universalist congregations have grown to appreciate alternative terms such as fellowship and retained them even though they have grown much larger or lost features sometimes associated with their use ( such as , in the case of fellowships , a traditionally lay - led worship model ) . Also of note is that there are many more people who identify as Unitarian Universalist on surveys than those who attend Unitarian Universalist congregations ( by a factor of four in a recent survey ) , reflecting those who have never joined ( and lapsed members ) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the Unitarian Universalist movement . Elevator speeches ( edit ) In 2004 , UU World magazine asked for contributions of `` elevator speeches '' explaining Unitarian Universalism . These are short speeches	Unitarian Universalism
442	443	that could be made in the course of an elevator ride to those who knew nothing of the religion . Here are examples of the speeches submitted : In Unitarian Universalist congregations , we gather in community to support our individual spiritual journeys . We trust that openness to one another 's experiences will enhance our understanding of our own links with the divine , with our history , and with one another . -- Rev. Jonalu Johnstone , Oklahoma City , OK Most Unitarian Universalists believe that nobody has a monopoly on all truth , or ultimate proof of the truth of everything in any one belief . Therefore , one 's own truth is unprovable , as is that of others . Consequently , we should respect the beliefs of others , as well as their right to hold those beliefs . Conversely , we expect that others should respect our right to our own beliefs . Several UU 's then , would likely hold as many different beliefs . Other beliefs they may hold in common are a respect for others , for nature , and for common decency , leading to a particular caring for the poor , the weak and the downtrodden . As a result , issues of justice , including social justice are held in common among most . -- Gene Douglas , Harrah , OK It 's a blessing each of us was born ; It matters what we do with our	Unitarian Universalism
443	444	lives ; What each of us knows about God is a piece of the truth ; We do n't have to do it alone . -- Laila Ibrahim , Berkeley , CA Worship and ritual ( edit ) As in theology , Unitarian Universalist worship and ritual are often a combination of elements derived from other faith traditions alongside original practices and symbols . In form , church services might be difficult to distinguish from those of a Protestant church , but they vary widely among congregations . Symbols ( edit ) The most common symbol of Unitarian Universalism is the flaming chalice , often framed by two overlapping rings that many interpret as representing Unitarianism and Universalism ( the symbol has no official interpretation ) . The chalice itself has long been a symbol of liberal religion , and indeed liberal Christianity ( the Disciples of Christ also use a chalice as their denomination symbol ) . The flaming chalice was initially the logo of the Unitarian Service Committee during the Second World War . It was created by Austrian artist Hans Deutsch , inspired by `` the kind of chalice which the Greeks and Romans put on their altars . The holy oil burning in it is a symbol of helpfulness and sacrifice . '' Nevertheless , other interpretations have been suggested , such as the chalice used by the followers of Czech Jan Hus , which was supposedly reverential of Eastern Orthodox traditions ; although Hus 's	Unitarian Universalism
444	445	early National Church was intrinsically an evangelical Protestant . In some agnostic historiographies The flaming chalice displayed a vague resemblance to a cross in some stylized representations , relying on the sepulchral traditions of the Hospitallers . Many Unitarian Universalist congregations light a chalice at the beginning of worship services . Other symbols include an off - center cross within a circle ( a Universalist symbol associated with the Humiliati movement in the 1950s , a group of reformist , liturgically minded clergy seeking to revive Universalism ) . Other symbols include a pair of open hands releasing a dove . Services of worship ( edit ) The Unitarian Meeting House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright , Shorewood Hills , Wisconsin . Religious services are usually held on Sundays and most closely resemble the form and format of Protestant worship in the Reformed tradition . Services at a vast majority of congregations follow a structure that focuses on a sermon or presentation by a minister , a lay leader of the congregation , or an invited speaker . Sermons may cover a wide range of topics . Since Unitarian Universalists do not recognize a particular text or set of texts as primary or inherently superior , inspiration can be found in many different religious or cultural texts as well as the personal experiences of the minister . The service also includes hymn - singing , accompanied by organ , piano , or other available instruments , and possibly led by	Unitarian Universalism
445	446	a song leader or choir . The most recent worship songbook published by the denomination , Singing the Journey contains 75 songs and is a supplement to the older Singing the Living Tradition which contains readings as well . Hymns typically sung in Unitarian Universalist services come from a variety of sources -- traditional hymn tunes with new or adapted lyrics , spirituals , folk songs from various cultures , or original compositions by Unitarian Universalist musicians are just a few . Instrumental music is also a common feature of the typical worship service , including preludes , offertory music , postludes , or music for contemplation . Pastoral elements of the service may include a time for sharing Joys and Sorrows / Concerns , where individuals in the congregation are invited to light a candle or say a few words about important events in their personal lives . Many also include a time of meditation or prayer , led by the minister or service leader , both spoken and silent . Responsive readings and stories for children are also typical . Many congregations also allow for a time at the end of the service , called `` talk back '' , where members of the congregation can respond to the sermon with their own insights and questions , or even disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the minister or invited speaker . Many Unitarian Universalist congregations no longer observe the Christian sacraments of baptism , communion , or confirmation	Unitarian Universalism
446	447	, at least in their traditional forms or under their traditional names . Congregations that continue these practices under their more traditional names are often federated churches or members of the Council of Christian Churches within the Unitarian Universalist Association ( CCCUUA ) , or may have active chapters associated with the Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship or similar covenant groups . `` Child dedications '' often replace more traditional infant baptisms ( though it should be noted that such `` dedications '' are sometimes practiced even in `` orthodox '' Christian communities that do not baptize infants for theological reasons ) . Annual celebrations of Water Communion and Flower Communion may replace or supplement Christian - style communion ( though many pluralist and Christian - oriented congregations may celebrate or otherwise make provisions for communion on Christian holy days ) . Confirmation may be replaced by a `` Coming of Age '' program , in which teenagers explore their individual religious identity , often developing their own credo . After they have completed exploring their spiritual beliefs , they write a speech about it which they then personally deliver to the congregation . Politics ( edit ) Historical politics of Unitarians and Universalists ( edit ) Main article : Unitarianism Main article : Universalist Church of America In the 19th century , Unitarians and Universalists were active in abolitionism , the women 's movement , the temperance movement , and other social reform movements . The second women 's rights	Unitarian Universalism
447	448	convention was held at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester , New York . Additionally , four Presidents of the United States were Unitarians : John Adams , John Quincy Adams , Millard Fillmore , and William Howard Taft . Politics of Unitarian Universalists ( edit ) A Unitarian Assembly in Louisville , Kentucky . Historically , Unitarian Universalists have often been active in political causes , notably the civil rights movement , the LGBT rights movement , the social justice movement , and the feminist movement . Susan B. Anthony , a Unitarian and Quaker , was extremely influential in the women 's suffrage movement . Unitarian Universalists and Quakers still share many principles . It is therefore common to see Unitarian Universalists and Quakers working together . Unitarian Universalists were and are still very involved in the fight to end racism in the United States . John Haynes Holmes , a Unitarian minister and social activist at The Community Church of New York -- Unitarian Universalist were among the founders of both the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) in 1909 and the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , chairing the latter for a time . James J. Reeb , a minister at All Souls Church , Unitarian , in Washington , D.C. and a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , was clubbed in Selma , Alabama on March 8 , 1965 , and died two days later of	Unitarian Universalism
448	449	massive head trauma . Two weeks after his death , Viola Liuzzo , a Unitarian Universalist civil rights activist , was murdered by white supremacists after her participation in the protest march from Selma to Montgomery , Alabama . The Selma to Montgomery marches for voting rights are best known as Bloody Sunday , although technically that refers only to March 7 , the most violent day of the three . The past head of the Unitarian Universalist Association 2001 -- 2009 , Rev. William G. Sinkford , is African - American , making Unitarian Universalism one of the first traditionally white denominations to be headed by a member of a racial minority . While political liberals make up a clear majority of Unitarian Universalists , the movement aspires to diversity , and officially welcomes congregants regardless of their political views . Politically conservative Unitarian Universalists point out that neither religious liberalism nor the Principles and Purposes of the UUA require liberal politics . Like the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists , politics are decided by individuals , not by congregations or the denomination . Several congregations have undertaken a series of organizational , procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a `` Welcoming Congregation '' : a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay , lesbian , bisexual & transgender ( LGBT ) members . Unitarian Universalist ministers perform same - sex unions and now same - sex marriages where legal ( and sometimes when	Unitarian Universalism
449	450	not , as a form of civil protest ) . On June 29 , 1984 , the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church `` to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions . '' Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same - sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces , as well as on the national level . Gay men , bisexuals , and lesbians are also regularly ordained as ministers , and a number of gay , bisexual , and lesbian ministers have , themselves , now become legally married to their partners . In May 2004 , Arlington Street Church , in Boston , Massachusetts , was the site of the first state - sanctioned same - sex marriage in the United States . The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same - sex marriage -- `` Standing on the Side of Love '' . In 2004 UU minister Rev. Debra Haffner of The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality , Justice , and Healing published An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality to affirm same - sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective . In December 2009 , Washington , D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty signed the bill to legalize same - sex marriage for the District of Columbia in All Souls Church , Unitarian ( Washington , D.C. ) Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness engages Unitarian Universalist ministers and other leaders to educate them on	Unitarian Universalism
450	451	polyamory . At the 2015 UUA General Assembly , the Association 's non-discrimination rule was amended to include the category of `` family and relationship structures '' ; the UUA has yet to take specific follow - up action on this , however . Many congregations are heavily involved in projects and efforts aimed at supporting environmental causes and sustainability . These are often termed `` seventh principle '' activities because of the seventh principle quoted above . Controversies ( edit ) External ( edit ) Lack of formal creed ( edit ) The lack of formal creed has been a cause for criticism among some who argue that Unitarian Universalism is thus without religious content . In May 2004 , Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn ruled that Unitarian Universalism was not a `` religion '' because it `` does not have one system of belief '' , and stripped the Red River Unitarian Universalist Church in Denison , Texas , of its tax - exempt status . However , within weeks , Strayhorn reversed her decision . Confusion with other groups ( edit ) There are separate movements and organizations who hold to classical Unitarian or Christian Universalist Christian theology and neither belong to the Unitarian Universalist Association nor consider themselves Unitarian Universalists . The American Unitarian Conference and the Christian Universalist Association are the two most significant organizations representing these theological beliefs today . Christians who hold these beliefs tend to consider themselves the true Unitarians or Universalists	Unitarian Universalism
451	452	and heirs of the theological legacy of the original American Unitarian Association or Universalist Church of America , and they do not wish to be confused with Unitarian Universalists . The Unity Church is another denomination that is often confused with Unitarian Universalism . Internal ( edit ) Language of reverence ( edit ) During the presidency of the Rev. William Sinkford , debate within the Unitarian Universalist movement has roiled over his call to return to or create an authentic Unitarian Universalist `` language of reverence . '' Sinkford has suggested that Unitarian Universalists have abandoned traditional religious language , thereby abandoning words with potential power to others who will then dictate their meanings in the public sphere . He has suggested that Unitarian Universalists regain their proper seat at the interfaith table by making this language their own . Others have reacted to this call by believing it to be part of an effort to return Unitarian Universalist congregations to more orthodox Christian worship patterns . Sinkford has denied this , citing the words of Unitarian Universalist humanists as examples of what he means by the `` language of reverence . '' The growth of humanism in Unitarianism was determined by a desire to raise the profile to a universal audience , educating atheists and agnostics in biblical literacy among the wider congregation of Unitarian Universalists , many of whom were born into families that lacked the rigour of a moral catechism . The debate included the publication	Unitarian Universalism
452	453	of a book by the UUA 's Beacon Press written by former UUA President John Buehrens . The book is titled Understanding the Bible : An Introduction for Skeptics , Seekers , and Religious Liberals , and is meant as a kind of handbook to be read alongside the Bible itself . It provides interpretative strategies , so that Unitarian Universalists ( among others ) might be able to engage in public debate about what the Bible says from a liberal religious perspective , rather than relinquishing to religious conservatives , and other more literal interpretations , all control over the book 's contents and significance in matters of public and civic import . Also an important work by Rev. Buehrens , along with Forrest Church , is A Chosen Faith : An Introduction to Unitarian Universalism , in which the authors explore the many sources of the living tradition of their chosen faith . Borrowing from other religions ( edit ) The `` borrowing '' of religious rituals from other faith traditions by Unitarian Universalists was discussed at the Unitarian Universalist General Assembly in 2001 during a seminar titled `` Cultural Appropriation : Reckless Borrowing or Appropriate Cultural Sharing '' by the Religious Education Dept , UUA . Of particular discussion was the borrowing rituals and practices that are sacred to specific tribes or using spiritual practices without real context . When UUs pick and choose from these things , it trivializes their spiritual practices . The specificity (	Unitarian Universalism
453	454	of their use ) is so complete , that visiting Native Americans do not participate in another tribe 's rituals , and to do so would be perceived as foolish . I would not even practice the rituals of my own tribe , because I am not an elder or spiritual leader . If this is true of her own people , then the use of these things by others who share no cultural context is seen not only as particularly foolish and inappropriate . Not all of this usage is inappropriate , though . Some taped music , written prayers , that kind of thing , might be all right , but it 's not right to fool around with it . If it 's not in context , if the user is not walking with us , if the user is not part of our struggle , then it is presumptuous . -- Reverend Danielle Di Bona , 2001 General Assembly Organizations ( edit ) Australia and New Zealand Unitarian Universalist Association ( ANZUUA ) is a Unitarian Universalist organization which serves as the organizing body for Unitarian and Universalist congregations in Australia and New Zealand .

In 2015 , there were 156,620 adult congregational members and 47,623 children enrolled in religious education programs . In 1956 , Sam Wells wrote that `` Unitarians and Universalists are considering merger which would have total U.S. membership of 160,000 ( 500,000 in world ) '' . In 1965 Conkin wrote that `` In 1961 , at the time of the merger , membership ( in the United States ) was 104,821 in 651 congregations , and the joint membership soared to its historically highest level in the mid-1960s ( an estimated 250,000 ) before falling sharply back in the 1970s ( ... ) '' . According to the 2008 Yearbook of American & Canadian Churches , the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations claimed 214,738 members in 2002 . Estimates from the 1990s put world membership between 120,000 and 600,000 .

Please help to clean it up to meet Wikipedia 's quality standards . Where appropriate , incorporate items into the main body of the article . ( September 2017 ) `` Send In the Clowns '' is a song written by Stephen Sondheim for the 1973 musical A Little Night Music , an adaptation of Ingmar Bergman 's film Smiles of a Summer Night . It is a ballad from Act Two , in which the character Desirée reflects on the ironies and disappointments of her life . Among other things , she looks back on an affair years earlier with the lawyer Fredrik . Meeting him after so long , she finds that he is now in an unconsummated marriage with a much younger woman . Desirée proposes marriage to rescue him from this situation , but he declines , citing his dedication to his bride . Reacting to his rejection , Desirée sings this song . The song is later reprised as a coda after Fredrik 's young wife runs away with his son , and Fredrik is finally free to accept Desirée 's offer . Sondheim wrote the song specifically for the actress	Send In the Clowns
491	492	Glynis Johns , who created the role of Desirée on Broadway . The song is structured with four verses and a bridge , and uses a complex compound meter . It became Sondheim 's most popular song after Frank Sinatra recorded it in 1973 and Judy Collins ' version charted in 1975 and 1977 . Subsequently , numerous other artists recorded the song , and it has become a jazz standard .

Instead , they symbolize fools , as Sondheim explained in a 1990 interview : I get a lot of letters over the years asking what the title means and what the song 's about ; I never thought it would be in any way esoteric . I wanted to use theatrical imagery in the song , because she 's an actress , but it 's not supposed to be a circus ( ... ) ( I ) t 's a theater reference meaning `` if the show is n't going well , let 's send in the clowns '' ; in other words , `` let 's do the jokes . '' I always want to know , when I 'm	Send In the Clowns
492	493	writing a song , what the end is going to be , so `` Send in the Clowns '' did n't settle in until I got the notion , `` Do n't bother , they 're here '' , which means that `` We are the fools . '' In a 2008 interview , Sondheim further clarified : As I think of it now , the song could have been called `` Send in the Fools '' . I knew I was writing a song in which Desirée is saying , `` are n't we foolish '' or `` are n't we fools ? '' Well , a synonym for fools is clowns , but `` Send in the Fools '' does n't have the same ring to it . Context ( edit ) Main article : A Little Night Music In an interview with Alan Titchmarsh , Judi Dench , who performed the role of Desirée in London , commented on the context of the song . The play is `` a dark play about people who , at the beginning , are with wrong partners and in the end it is hopefully going to become right , and she ( Desiree ) mistimes her life in a way and realizes when she re-meets the man she had an affair with and had a child by ( though he does not know that ) , that she loves him and he is the man she wants . '' Some	Send In the Clowns
493	494	years before the play begins , Desirée was a young , attractive actress , whose passions were the theater and men . She lived her life dramatically , flitting from man to man . Fredrik was one of her many lovers and fell deeply in love with Desirée , but she declined to marry him . The play implies that when they parted Desirée may have been pregnant with his child . A few months before the play begins , Fredrik married a beautiful woman who at 18 years old was much younger than he . In Act One , Fredrik meets Desirée again , and is introduced to her daughter , a precocious adolescent suggestively named Fredrika . Fredrik explains to Desirée that he is now married to the young woman , whom he loves , but who is still a virgin and refuses to have sex with him . Desirée and Fredrik then make love . Act Two begins days later , and Desirée realizes that she truly loves Fredrik . She tells Fredrik that he needs to be rescued from his marriage , and she proposes to him . Fredrik explains to Desirée that he has been swept off the ground and is `` in the air '' in love with his beautiful , young wife , and apologizes for having misled her . Fredrik walks across the room , while Desirée remains sitting on the bed ; as she feels both intense sadness and anger ,	Send In the Clowns
494	495	at herself , her life and her choices , she sings `` Send in the Clowns '' . Not long thereafter , Fredrik 's young wife runs away with his son , and he is free to accept Desirée 's proposal , and the song is reprised as a coda . Score ( edit ) History ( edit ) Sondheim wrote the lyrics and music over a two - day period during rehearsals for the play 's Broadway debut , specifically for the actress Glynis Johns , who created the role of Desirée . According to Sondheim , `` Glynis had a lovely , crystal voice , but sustaining notes was not her thing . I wanted to write short phrases , so I wrote a song full of questions '' and the song 's melody is within a small music range : We hired Glynis Johns to play the lead , though she had a nice little silvery voice . But I 'd put all the vocal weight of the show on the other characters because we needed somebody who was glamorous , charming and could play light comedy , and pretty , and to find that in combination with a good voice is very unlikely , but she had all the right qualities and a nice little voice . So I did n't write much for her and I did n't write anything in the second act . And the big scene between her and her ex-lover ,	Send In the Clowns
495	496	I had started on a song for him because it 's his scene . And Hal Prince , who directed it , said he thought that the second act needed a song for her , and this was the scene to do it in . And so he directed the scene in such a way that even though the dramatic thrust comes from the man 's monologue , and she just sits there and reacts , he directed it so you could feel the weight going to her reaction rather than his action . And I went down and saw it and it seemed very clear what was needed , and so that made it very easy to write . And then I wrote it for her voice , because she could n't sustain notes . Was n't that kind of singing voice . So I knew I had to write things in short phrases , and that led to questions , and so again , I would n't have written a song so quickly if I had n't known the actress ... I wrote most of it one night and finished part of the second chorus , and I 'd gotten the ending ... ( T ) he whole thing was done in two days . Lyrics ( edit ) The lyrics of the song are written in four verses and a bridge and sung by Desirée . As Sondheim explains , Desirée experiences both deep regret and furious	Send In the Clowns
496	497	anger : `` Send in the Clowns '' was never meant to be a soaring ballad ; it 's a song of regret . And it 's a song of a lady who is too upset and too angry to speak -- meaning to sing for a very long time . She is furious , but she does n't want to make a scene in front of Fredrik because she recognizes that his obsession with his 18 - year - old wife is unbreakable . So she gives up ; so it 's a song of regret and anger , and therefore fits in with short - breathed phrases . Meter and key ( edit ) The song was originally performed in the key of D flat major . The song uses an unusual and complex meter , which alternates between 12 / 8 and 9 / 8 . These are two complex compound meters that evoke the sense of a waltz used throughout the score of the show . Sondheim tells the story : When I worked with Leonard Bernstein on West Side Story , one of the things I learned from him was not always necessarily to think in terms of 2 - , 4 - and 8 - bar phrases . I was already liberated enough before I met him not to be sticking to 32 - bar songs , but I tend to think square . I tend to think ... it 's probably because I	Send In the Clowns
497	498	was brought up on mid-19th and late - 19th Century music , and you know it 's fairly square ; there are not an awful lot of meter changes . You often will shorten or lengthen a bar for rhythmic purposes and for energy , but ... when you switch in the middle ( of a song ) , particularly when it 's a modest song , when you 're not writing an aria , you know ... ( I mean , ) if you 're writing something like Sweeney Todd , where people sing at great length , you expect switches of meter , because it helps variety . But in a little 36 - or 40 - bar song , to switch meters around is almost perverse , because the song does n't get a chance to establish its own rhythm . But the problem is , what would you do ? : Would you go , `` Is n't it rich ? ( two , three ) Are we a pair ? ( two , three ) Me here at last on the ground ( three ) , you in mid-air . '' Lenny ( Bernstein ) taught me to think in terms of , `` Do you really need the extra beat ( after ' ground ' ) or not . '' Just because you 've got four bars of four , if you come across a bar that does n't need the extra beat ,	Send In the Clowns
498	499	then put a bar of three in . So ... the 9 ( beat bars ) and 12 ( beat bars ) that alternate in that song were not so much consciously arrived at as they were by the emotionality of the lyric . Styles ( edit ) `` Send in the Clowns '' is performed in two completely different styles : dramatic and lyric . The dramatic style is the theatrical performance by Desirée , and this style emphasizes Desirée 's feelings of anger and regret , and the dramatic style acts as a cohesive part of the play . The lyric style is the concert performance , and this style emphasizes the sweetness of the melody and the poetry of the lyrics . Most performances are in concert , so they emphasize the beauty of the melody and lyrics . Sondheim teaches both dramatic and lyric performers several important elements for an accurate rendition : The dramatic performer must take on the character of Desirée : a woman who finally realizes that she has misspent her youth on the shallow life . She is both angry and sad , and both must be seen in the performance . Two important examples are the contrast between the lines , `` Quick , send in the clowns '' and `` Well , maybe next year . '' Sondheim teaches that the former should be steeped in self - loathing , while the latter should emphasize regret . Thus , the	Send In the Clowns
499	500	former is clipped , with a break between `` quick '' and `` send , '' while the latter `` well '' is held pensively . Sondheim himself apologizes for flaws in his composition . For example , in the line , `` Well , maybe next year , '' the melodic emphasis is on the word year but the dramatic emphasis must be on the word next : The word `` next '' is important : `` Maybe next year '' as opposed to `` this year '' . ( Desirée means , ) `` All right , I 've screwed it up this year . Maybe next year I 'll do something right in my life . '' So ( it 's ) `` well , maybe next year '' even though it is n't accented in the music . This is a place where the lyric and the music are n't as apposite as they might be , because the important word is `` next '' , and yet the accented word is `` year '' . That 's my fault , but ( something the performer must ) overcome . Another example arises from Sondheim 's roots as a speaker of American rather than British English : The line `` Do n't you love farce ? '' features two juxtaposed labiodental fricative sounds ( the former ( v ) voiced , the latter ( f ) devoiced ) . American concert and stage performers will often	Send In the Clowns
500	501	fail to `` breathe '' and / or `` voice '' between the two fricatives , leading audiences familiar with British slang to hear `` Do n't you love arse ? , '' misinterpreting the lyric or at the least perceiving an unintended double entendre . Sondheim agrees that `` ( i ) t 's an awkward moment in the lyric , but that v and that f should be separated . '' In the line of the fourth verse , `` I thought that you 'd want what I want . Sorry , my dear , '' the performer must communicate the connection between the `` want '' and the `` sorry '' . Similarly , Sondheim insists that performers separately enunciate the adjacent ts in the line , `` There ought to be clowns . '' Popular success ( edit ) The musical , with the song , debuted on Broadway in 1973 . The song became popular with theater audiences but had not become a pop hit . Sondheim explained how the song became a hit : First of all , it was n't a hit for two years . I mean , the first person to sing it was Bobby Short , who happened to see the show in Boston , and it was exactly his kind of song : He 's a cabaret entertainer . And then my memory is that Judy Collins picked it up , but she recorded it in England ; Sinatra	Send In the Clowns
501	502	heard it and recorded it . And between the two of them , they made it a hit . Frank Sinatra recorded `` Send in the Clowns '' in 1973 for his comeback album Ol ' Blue Eyes Is Back , which attained gold status . Gordon Jenkins arranged the song . It was also released as a single , with `` Let Me Try Again '' on side B . Two years later , in 1975 , Judy Collins recorded `` Send in the Clowns '' and included it on her album Judith . The song was released as a single , which soon became a major pop hit . It remained on the Billboard Hot 100 for 11 weeks in 1975 , reaching Number 36 . Then , in 1977 , the song again reached the Billboard Hot 100 , where it remained for 16 weeks and reached Number 19 . At the Grammy Awards of 1976 , the Judy Collins performance of the song was named `` Song of the Year '' . After Sinatra and Collins recorded the song , it was recorded by Bing Crosby ( for his album That 's What Life Is All About ) , Kenny Rogers , Lou Rawls and many others . In 1985 , Sondheim added a verse for Barbra Streisand to use in her concert performances and recording , which was featured on The Broadway Album . In 1986 , her version became a Number 25 Billboard Hot	Send In the Clowns
502	503	Adult Contemporary hit . The song has become a jazz standard with performances by Count Basie , Sarah Vaughan , the Stan Kenton Orchestra and many others . Recordings ( edit ) The song occurs on over 900 records by hundreds of performers in a wide variety of arrangements .

The British were among the most important colonizers of the Americas , and their American empire came to rival the Spanish American colonies in military and economic might . Three types of colonies existed in the British Empire in America during the height of its power in the 18th Century . These were charter colonies , proprietary colonies and royal colonies . A group of 13 British American colonies collectively broke from the British Empire in the 1770s through a successful revolution , establishing the modern United States . After the end of the Napoleonic Wars ( 1803 -- 15 ) , British territories in the Americas were slowly granted more responsible government . In 1838 the Durham Report recommended full responsible government for Canada , but this was not fully implemented for another decade . Eventually , with the Confederation of Canada , the Canadian colonies were granted significant autonomy and became	British colonization of the Americas
518	519	a self - governing Dominion in 1867 . Other colonies in the Americas followed at a much slower pace . In this way , two countries in North America , ten in the Caribbean , and one in South America have received their independence from the United Kingdom . All of these , except the United States , are members of the Commonwealth of Nations and nine are Commonwealth realms . The eight current British overseas territories in the Americas have varying degrees of self - government .

519	520	Gilbert 's founding of the British overseas Empire A number of English colonies were established under a system of Proprietary Governors , who were appointed under mercantile charters to English joint stock companies to found and run settlements . In 1607 , Jamestown , Virginia was founded by the London Company ( also known as the Virginia Company ) . In Newfoundland , a chartered company known as the Society of Merchant Venturers established a permanent settlement at Cuper 's Cove , from 1610 . St. George 's , Bermuda was founded by the Virginia Company , in 1612 . In 1664 , England took over the Dutch colony of New Netherland ( including its capital of New Amsterdam ) which England renamed the Province of New York . With New Netherland , the English also came to control the former New Sweden ( in what is now Delaware ) , which the Dutch had conquered earlier . This later became part of Pennsylvania after that was established in 1680 . Scottish colonies in North America ( edit ) Main article : Scottish colonization of the Americas The Kingdom of Scotland tried unsuccessfully to establish a colony at Darién , and the Scottish colonization of Nova Scotia ( New Scotland ) lasted from 1629 to 1632 . Thousands of Scotsmen also participated in English colonization before the two countries were united in 1707 . British colonies in North America ( edit ) See also : British America , British North	British colonization of the Americas
520	521	America , and Thirteen Colonies The Kingdom of Great Britain acquired the French colony of Acadia in 1713 and then Canada and the Spanish colony of Florida in 1763 . After being renamed the Province of Quebec , the former French Canada was divided into two Provinces , the Canadas , consisting of the old settled country of Lower Canada ( today Quebec ) and the newly settled Upper Canada ( today Ontario ) . In the north , the Hudson 's Bay Company actively traded for fur with the indigenous peoples , and had competed with French , Aboriginal , and Métis fur traders . The company came to control the entire drainage basin of Hudson Bay , called Rupert 's Land . The small part of the Hudson Bay drainage south of the 49th parallel went to the United States in the Anglo - American Convention of 1818 . Thirteen of Great Britain 's colonies rebelled in the American Revolutionary War , beginning in 1775 , primarily over representation , local laws and tax issues , and established the United States of America , which was recognised internationally with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 3 September 1783 . Great Britain also colonised the west coast of North America , indirectly via the Hudson 's Bay Company licenses west of the Rocky Mountains : the Columbia District and New Caledonia fur district . Most of these were jointly claimed as the Oregon Country by the United	British colonization of the Americas
521	522	States from 1818 until the 49th parallel was established as the international boundary west of the Rockies by the Oregon Treaty of 1846 . The Colony of Vancouver Island , founded in 1849 , and the Colony of British Columbia , founded in 1858 , were combined in 1866 under the name Colony of British Columbia , and joined the Confederation in 1871 . British Columbia was expanded with the inclusion of the Stikine Territory in 1863 ; and upon joining Confederation the Peace River Block , formerly part of Rupert 's Land , was added . In 1867 , the colonies of New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , and the Province of Canada ( the southern portion of modern - day Ontario and Quebec ) combined to form a self - governing dominion , named Canada , within the British Empire ( the term `` kingdom '' was avoided so as to not provoke the United States ) . Quebec ( including what is now the southern portion of Ontario ) and Nova Scotia ( including what is now New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island ) had been ceded to Britain by the French . The colonies of Prince Edward Island and British Columbia joined over the next six years , and Newfoundland joined in 1949 . Rupert 's Land and the North - Western Territory were ceded to Canada in 1870 . This area now consists of the provinces of Manitoba ( admitted after negotiation between Canada and	British colonization of the Americas

Val d'Europe Disneyland Paris , originally Euro Disney Resort , is an entertainment resort in Marne - la - Vallée , a new town located 32 km ( 20 mi ) east of the centre of Paris . It is the most visited theme park in Europe . It is owned by The Walt Disney Company through subsidiary Euro Disney S.C.A. The resort covers 4,800	Disneyland Paris
538	539	acres ( 19 km ) and encompasses two theme parks , many resort hotels , a shopping , dining , and entertainment complex , and a golf course , in addition to several additional recreational and entertainment venues . Disneyland Park is the original theme park of the complex , opening with the resort on 12 April 1992 . A second theme park , Walt Disney Studios Park , opened in 2002 . Disneyland Paris celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2017 . In 25 years , 320 million people visited Disneyland Paris . The resort is the second Disney park to open outside the United States following the opening of the Tokyo Disney Resort in 1983 . The current CEO is Catherine Powell . Walt Disney announced a € 1 billion ( $1.25 billion ) bailout plan to rescue its subsidiary Disneyland Paris , the Financial Times reported on 6 October 2014 . The park is burdened by its debt , which is calculated at about € 1.75 billion ( $2.20 billion ) and roughly 15 times its gross average earnings . Until June 2017 , Disney only held a majority stake in the resort , when they bought the remaining shares . In 2017 The Walt Disney Company offered an informal takeover of Euro Disney S.C.A. , buying 9 % of the company from Kingdom Holding and an open offer of 2 Euro per share for the remaining stock . This brought The Walt Disney Company 's total ownership	Disneyland Paris
539	540	to 85.7 % . The Walt Disney company will also invest an additional 1.5 Billion Euro to strengthen the company .

Under the leadership of E. Cardon Walker , Tokyo Disneyland opened in 1983 in Japan with instant success , forming a catalyst for international expansion . In late 1984 the heads of Disney 's theme park division , Dick Nunis and Jim Cora , presented a list of approximately 1,200 possible European locations for the park . Britain , France , Italy and Spain were all considered . However , Britain and Italy were dropped from the list due to both lacking a suitable expanse of flat land . By March 1985 , the number of possible locations for the	Disneyland Paris
540	541	park had been reduced to four ; two in France and two in Spain . Both nations saw the potential economic advantages of a Disney theme park and offered competing financing deals to Disney . Both Spanish sites were located near the Mediterranean and offered a subtropical climate similar to Disney 's parks in California and Florida . Disney had asked each site to provide average temperatures for every month for the previous 40 years , which proved a complicated endeavour as none of the records were computerised and were registered on paper . The site in Pego , Alicante became the front - runner , but the location was controversial as it would have meant the destruction of Marjal de Pego - Oliva marshlands , a site of natural beauty and one of the last homes of the almost extinct Samaruc or Valencia Toothcarp , so there was some local outcry among environmentalists . Disney had also shown interest in a site near Toulon in southern France , not far from Marseille . The pleasing landscape of that region , as well as its climate , made the location a top competitor for what would be called Euro Disneyland . However , shallow bedrock was encountered beneath the site , which would have rendered construction too difficult . Finally , a site in the rural town of Marne - la - Vallée was chosen because of its proximity to Paris and its central location in Western Europe . This	Disneyland Paris
541	542	location was estimated to be no more than a four - hour drive for 68 million people and no more than a two - hour flight for a further 300 million . Michael Eisner , Disney 's CEO at the time , signed the first letter of agreement with the French government for the 20 - square - kilometre ( 4,940 - acre ) site on 18 December 1985 , and the first financial contracts were drawn up during the following spring . The final contract was signed by the leaders of the Walt Disney Company and the French government and territorial collectivities on 24 March 1987 . Construction began in August 1988 , and in December 1990 , an information centre named `` Espace Euro Disney '' was opened to show the public what was being constructed . Plans for a theme park next to Euro Disneyland based on the entertainment industry , Disney - MGM Studios Europe , quickly went into development , scheduled to open in 1996 with a construction budget of US $2.3 billion . The construction manager was Bovis . Design and construction ( edit ) ' Disneyland Hotel ' . Through the hotel is the entrance ticket hall to the Park . In order to provide lodging to patrons , it was decided that 5,200 Disney - owned hotel rooms would be built within the complex . In March 1988 , Disney and a council of architects ( Frank Gehry , Michael Graves ,	Disneyland Paris
542	543	Robert A.M. Stern , Stanley Tigerman , and Robert Venturi ) decided on an exclusively American theme in which each hotel would depict a region of the United States . At the time of the opening in April 1992 , seven hotels collectively housing 5,800 rooms had been built . An entertainment , shopping , and dining complex based on Walt Disney World 's Downtown Disney was designed by Frank Gehry . With its towers of oxidised silver and bronze - coloured stainless steel under a canopy of lights , it opened as Festival Disney . For a projected daily attendance of 55,000 , Euro Disney planned to serve an estimated 14,000 people per hour inside the Euro Disneyland park . In order to accomplish this , 29 restaurants were built inside the park ( with a further 11 restaurants built at the Euro Disney resort hotels and five at Festival Disney ) . Menus and prices were varied with an American flavour predominant and Disney 's precedent of serving alcoholic beverages was continued in the park . 2,300 patio seats ( 30 % of park seating ) were installed to satisfy Europeans ' expected preference of eating outdoors in good weather . In test kitchens at Walt Disney World , recipes were adapted for European tastes . Walter Meyer , executive chef for menu development at Euro Disney and executive chef of food projects development at Walt Disney World noted , `` A few things we did need to	Disneyland Paris
543	544	change , but most of the time people kept telling us , ' Do your own thing . Do what 's American ' . '' Recruitment / employment ( edit ) Unlike Disney 's American theme parks , Euro Disney aimed for permanent employees ( an estimated requirement of 12,000 for the theme park itself ) , as opposed to seasonal and temporary part - time employees . Casting centres were set up in Paris , London , and Amsterdam . However , it was understood by the French government and Disney that `` a concentrated effort would be made to tap into the local French labour market '' . Disney sought workers with sufficient communication skills , who spoke two European languages ( French and one other ) , and were socially outgoing . Following precedent , Euro Disney set up its own Disney University to train workers . 24,000 people had applied by November 1991 . Controversies ( edit ) The prospect of a Disney park in France was a subject of debate and controversy . Critics , who included prominent French intellectuals , denounced what they considered to be the cultural imperialism of Euro Disney and felt it would encourage an unhealthy American type of consumerism in France . For others , Euro Disney became a symbol of America within France . On 28 June 1992 , a group of French farmers blockaded Euro Disney in protest of farm policies supported at the time by the United	Disneyland Paris
544	545	States . A journalist at the centre - right French newspaper Le Figaro wrote , `` I wish with all my heart that the rebels would set fire to ( Euro ) Disneyland . '' Ariane Mnouchkine , a Parisian stage director , named the concept a `` cultural Chernobyl '' , a phrase which would be echoed in the media during Euro Disney 's initial years . In response , French philosopher Michel Serres noted , `` It is not America that is invading us . It is we who adore it , who adopt its fashions and above all , its words . '' Euro Disney S.C.A. 's then - chairman Robert Fitzpatrick responded , `` We did n't come in and say O.K. , we 're going to put a beret and a baguette on Mickey Mouse . We are who we are . '' Topics of controversy also included Disney 's American managers requiring English to be spoken at all meetings and Disney 's appearance code for members of staff , which listed regulations and limitations for the use of makeup , facial hair , tattoos , jewellery , and more . French labour unions mounted protests against the appearance code , which they saw as `` an attack on individual liberty '' . Others criticised Disney as being insensitive to French culture , individualism , and privacy , because restrictions on individual or collective liberties were illegal under French law , unless it could be	Disneyland Paris
545	546	demonstrated that the restrictions are requisite to the job and do not exceed what is necessary . Disney countered by saying that a ruling that barred them from imposing such an employment standard could threaten the image and long - term success of the park . `` For us , the appearance code has a great effect from a product identification standpoint , '' said Thor Degelmann , Euro Disney 's personnel director . `` Without it we could n't be presenting the Disney product that people would be expecting . '' Opening day and early years ( edit ) Euro Disney opened for employee preview and testing in March 1992 . During this time visitors were mostly park employees and their family members , who tested facilities and operations . The press were able to visit the day before the park 's opening day on 12 April . On 12 April 1992 , Euro Disney Resort and its theme park , Euro Disneyland , officially opened , on the same date that Mediaset 's La Cinq ( unrelated to the resort ) ceased transmissions . Visitors were warned of chaos on the roads . A government survey indicated that half a million people carried by 90,000 cars might attempt to enter the complex . French radio warned traffic to avoid the area . By midday , the car park was approximately half full , suggesting an attendance level below 25,000 . Explanations of the lower - than - expected	Disneyland Paris
546	547	turnout included speculation that people heeded the advice to stay away and that the one - day strike that cut the direct RER railway connection to Euro Disney from the centre of Paris made the park inaccessible . Due to the European recession that August , the park faced financial difficulties as there were a lack of things to do and an overabundance of hotels , leading to underperformance . A new Indiana Jones roller - coaster ride was opened at Euro Disney in the summer the next year , 1993 . However , a few weeks after the ride opened there were problems with the emergency brakes which resulted in guest injuries . The ride was shut down for a short time so that safety investigations could be conducted . In 1994 the company was still having financial difficulties . There were rumours that Euro Disney was getting close to having to declare bankruptcy . The banks and the backers had meetings to work out some of the financial problems facing Euro Disney . It was in March 1994 that Team Disney went into negotiations with the banks so that they could get some help for their debt . As a last resort , the Walt Disney Company threatened to close the Disneyland Paris park , leaving the banks with the land . Financial , attendance , and employment struggles ( edit ) Disney 's Newport Bay Club In May 1992 , entertainment magazine The Hollywood Reporter reported that	Disneyland Paris
547	548	about 25 % of Euro Disney 's workforce -- approximately 3,000 people -- had resigned from their jobs because of unacceptable working conditions . It also reported that the park 's attendance was far behind expectations . The disappointing attendance can be at least partly explained by the recession and increased unemployment , which was affecting France and most of the rest of the developed world at this time ; when construction of the resort began , the economy was still on an upswing . Euro Disney S.C.A. responded in an interview with The Wall Street Journal , in which Robert Fitzpatrick claimed only 1,000 people had left their jobs . In response to the financial situation , Fitzpatrick ordered that the Disney - MGM Studios Europe project would be put on hiatus until a further decision could be made . Prices at the hotels were reduced . Despite these efforts in May 1992 , park attendance was around 25,000 ( some reports give a figure of 30,000 ) instead of the predicted 60,000 . The Euro Disney Company stock price spiralled downwards and on 23 July 1992 , Euro Disney announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300 million French francs . During Euro Disney 's first winter , hotel occupancy was so low that it was decided to close the Newport Bay Club hotel during the season . Initial hopes were that each visitor would spend around US $33 per day ,	Disneyland Paris
548	549	but near the end of 1992 , analysts found spending to be around 12 % lower . Efforts to improve attendance included serving alcoholic beverages with meals inside the Euro Disneyland park , in response to a presumed European demand , which began 12 June 1993 . By the summer of 1994 , Euro Disney was burdened with $3 billion worth of debt . Disney CFO Richard Nanula and Wall Street financier Steve Norris worked with Alwaleed 's business advisor Mustafa Al Hejailan to rescue the overleveraged company . In that deal , the Walt Disney Corporation 's 49 percent stake was reduced to 39 percent , the banks agreed to forego interest payments until 1997 , Disney wrote off royalties and fees until 1999 , and Alwaleed agreed to pay $345 million for a 24 percent stake in Euro Disney . 1995 turnaround ( edit ) On 31 May 1995 , a new attraction opened at the theme park . Space Mountain : De la Terre à la Lune had been planned since the inception of Euro Disneyland under the name Discovery Mountain , but was reserved for a revival of public interest . With a redesign of the attraction ( which had premiered as Space Mountain at the Walt Disney World Resort 's Magic Kingdom in 1975 ) including a `` cannon launch '' system , inversions , and an on - ride soundtrack , the US $100 million attraction was dedicated in a ceremony attended by celebrities	Disneyland Paris
549	550	such as Elton John , Claudia Schiffer , and Buzz Aldrin . On 25 July 1995 , Euro Disney S.C.A. reported its first ever quarterly profit of US $35.3 million . On 15 November 1995 , the results for the fiscal year ending 30 September 1995 , were released ; in one year the theme park 's attendance had climbed from 8.8 million to 10.7 million -- an increase of 21 % . Hotel occupancy had also climbed from 60 to 68.5 % . After debt payments , Disneyland Paris ended the year with a net profit of US $22.8 million . 2000 onwards ( edit ) As of March 2002 , Euro Disney underwent a name change to Disneyland Resort Paris . In 2002 , Euro Disney S.C.A. and the Walt Disney Company announced another annual profit for Disneyland Paris . However , it then incurred a net loss in the three years following . By March 2004 , the Walt Disney Company had agreed to write off all debt that Euro Disney S.C.A. owed to the Walt Disney Company . On 1 December 2003 , Euro Disney S.C.A launched the ' Need Magic ' campaign , which lasted until March 2006 to bring new , first - time European visitors to the resort . And by 2005 , having been open fewer than fifteen years , Disneyland Paris had become the number one tourist destination for Europe , outselling the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower . In March	Disneyland Paris
550	551	2006 , Disneyland Resort Paris launched the advertising campaign , `` believe in your dreams '' and paired with the TGV East European Line to encourage European family attendance to the resort . Shortly after announcing a 12 % increase in revenues for the fiscal year of 2007 , Euro Disney S.C.A. implemented a `` reverse split '' consolidation of shares of 100 to 1 . August 2008 brought the resort 's 200 millionth visitor , and made for the third consecutive year of growth in revenues for the resort as well as record a record of 15.3 million visitors in attendance . In 2009 , the resort demonstrated dedication to the recruitment of new employment positions , especially for the Christmas and summer seasons , which continued in 2010 and 2011 when 2,000 and 3,000 employment contracts being offered , respectively . The 2009 fiscal year saw a decrease in revenues by 7 % and a net loss of 63 million followed by stable revenues at 1.2 billion in fiscal 2010 . Euro Disney S.C.A. refinanced their debt to Walt Disney Company again for 1.3 billion euros in September 2012 . A study done by the Inter-ministerial Delegation reviewing Disneyland Paris ' contribution to the French economy was released in time for the Resort 's 20th anniversary in March 2012 . It found that despite the resort 's financial hardships , it has generated `` 37 billion euros in tourism - related revenues over twenty years , '' supports	Disneyland Paris
551	552	on average 55,000 jobs in France annually , and that one job at Disneyland Paris generates nearly three jobs elsewhere in France . For the first time in the resort 's history , both the Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park closed from 14 to 17 November 2015 , as part of France 's national days of mourning following the November 2015 Paris attacks . On 19 June 2017 , the resort 's operating company , Euro Disney S.C.A , was acquired by The Walt Disney Company , in the process , giving them full control of the resort . On 27 February 2018 , Bob Iger announced that The Walt Disney Company will invest € 2 billion into the Disneyland Paris resort . The Walt Disney Studios Park will be expanded with three new areas based upon Marvel , Frozen and Star Wars . In addition to the three new areas , the expansion includes a new lake , which will be the focal point for entertainment experiences and will also connect each of the new park areas . The first phase of the expansion will be completed in 2021 . Name changes ( edit ) Disneyland Paris and its assets have been subject to a number of name changes , initially an effort to overcome the negative publicity that followed the inception of Euro Disney . Euro Disney was renamed Disneyland Paris in order to help locate the theme park more easily on the map . In	Disneyland Paris
552	553	2002 , Disney 's CEO noted , As Americans , the word ' Euro ' is believed to mean glamorous or exciting . For Europeans it turned out to be a term they associated with business , currency and commerce . Renaming the park ' Disneyland Paris ' was a way of identifying it with one of the most romantic and exciting cities in the world . -- Michael Eisner Resort Names ( edit ) 12 April 1992 -- 31 May 1994 : Euro Disney Resort 1 June -- 30 September 1994 : Euro Disney Resort Paris 1 October 1994 -- 15 March 2002 : Disneyland Paris 16 March 2002 -- 3 April 2009 : Disneyland Resort Paris 4 April 2009 -- present : Disneyland Paris The complex ( edit ) Disneyland Paris encompasses 4,800 acres ( 19 km ) and contains 2 theme parks , 7 resort hotels , 7 associated hotels , a golf course , railway station , a large outlet centre ( la vallée village ) , and a large shopping mall : Val d'Europe .

557	558	are strictly forbidden in all backstage areas . The edges of the parks are lined with ride buildings and foliage to hide areas that are not for the public to see . Numerous area gates allow entrance into the park for cast members , parade floats , etc . When area gates around the park are open , anything that can be seen through them is considered to be on - stage and part of the Disney Magic . Therefore , from the moment the gates are open , all of the cast must be in character and in place to ' perform ' . As the complex is so big , shuttle buses take cast members to different parts of the parks via service roads located around the perimeter of the parks . Many attractions are housed in large , soundstage - like buildings called `` show buildings '' , some of which are partially or completely disguised by external theming . Generally , show buildings are painted a dull green colour in areas not seen by guests ; this choice helps to disguise them among the foliage and make them less visually obtrusive . Walt Disney Imagineering has termed this colour `` Go Away Green . '' Most show buildings have off - white flat roofs that support HVAC units and footpaths for maintenance cast members . Housed inside show buildings are the actual attractions , which include hidden walkways , service areas , control rooms , and	Disneyland Paris

Heather Phares , reviewing for Allmusic , said `` It 's fitting that the film 's soundtrack is dominated by ballads that feel like a long goodbye to Bella , Edward , and Jacob '' , and said `` As with the other volumes of the series ' music , however , this collection provides a surprisingly good showcase for female , indie - ish talent . '' Phares concluded , `` While Breaking Dawn is n't one of the more dynamic Twilight Saga soundtracks , it is one of the more emotive ones , and just may help fans get some closure as one of the biggest film franchises of the 2000s and 2010s comes to a close .

641	642	Madame Giry - wikipedia Madame Giry This article needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( February 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Madame Giry The Phantom of the Opera character Giry as portrayed by Miranda Richardson in the 2004 film version . First appearance The Phantom of the Opera Created by Gaston Leroux Portrayed by Miranda Richardson Information Gender Female Occupation Concierge Children Meg Giry ( daughter ) Nationality French Madame Giry is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux 's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera . She is a fairly intermediate character in the novel , although her role is much increased in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical . This article will deal with both versions separately . Madame Giry is also a character in the musical Love Never Dies , a sequel to The Phantom of the Opera . Madame Giry in the Phantom of the Opera novel ( edit ) Madame Giry is an aging woman who works as a concierge in the rue de Provence , who looks after patrons of the Opera , principally those who sit in the boxes . One night , whilst working , Madame Giry hears a male voice in Box Five , which she knows to be empty . After recovering from her surprise , she learns to trust the `` voice	Madame Giry
642	643	'' and does odd jobs for the owner . In the novel , it is never mentioned that she knows Christine Daaé . One of her little tasks is to collect the monthly `` salary '' of 20,000 francs owed to the `` Opera Ghost . '' The Ghost instructs the managers of the Opera to hand Madame Giry a sealed envelope containing the money . The Ghost has provided her with a duplicate that contains play money ; she knows nothing of the contents of either envelope . Placing the duplicate in Box Five , she slips the real one into the back pocket of a manager 's dress - coat while he is wearing it . The Ghost later retrieves the money from this pocket when the managers are back in the office , using a trapdoor built into the floor . The managers , Firmin Richard and Armand Moncharmin , remove Madame Giry from her post , finding her troublesome . There is an indication that they consider her to be the Ghost , but since the Ghost remains in the Opera Garnier after Madame Giry is removed , this is clearly an erroneous suggestion . As they search for a replacement concierge , they invite one candidate to sit in the audience for a performance . The chandelier falls that night , killing the candidate . Following direct intervention by the Opera Ghost , Madame Giry is eventually reinstated into her role as concierge . During	Madame Giry
643	644	a meeting with the managers , she explains that she once found a note in Box Five , written by the Ghost and listing a number of dancers and singers who married into royalty and the nobility , with her daughter Meg included as eventually becoming an empress . This note was enough to persuade Madame Giry to help the Ghost ; later in life , Meg did become the Baroness de Castelot - Barbezac . Madame Giry in the 1986 the Phantom of the Opera musical ( edit ) In Andrew Lloyd Webber 's The Phantom of the Opera , Madame Giry 's role is changed to become a slightly younger woman who now works as a choreographer of the corps de ballet . She is shown holding a cane , which she uses to beat time with the music , but which she is rarely shown to use otherwise . When the Opera Diva , Carlotta Giudicelli , walks out during rehearsals at the start of the show , it is Madame Giry , and her daughter , Meg , who suggest Christine Daaé for the leading role . Later in the show , she receives one of the Phantom 's `` Notes '' in both reprises of this tune . The first one she gives to M. Firmin , but the second she reads herself , being over-spoken by the Phantom part way through . While there is very little history given between the Phantom and Madame	Madame Giry
644	645	Giry in the musical , a small scene was extended in the film version , showing a young Madame Giry rescuing the Phantom from a traveling circus and hiding him in the Opera House . This was taken from Frederick Forsyth 's sequel , The Phantom of Manhattan . Even in the extended scene she does not give any indication why she is working for the Phantom ( other than sympathy and her appreciation for his genius ) , unlike the reasons given in the novel . In the 2004 film version of the musical ( in which she is played by Miranda Richardson ) , Madame Giry is shown almost to be an accomplice of the Phantom , failing to notify people when he locks Christine 's dressing room ( though she could have alerted someone and they did n't listen ) or when she spots him in the rafters during a scene . This collusion does not appear in the stage musical . Regularly during the musical , Madame Giry tries to stop the Managers from doing any harm to the Phantom and defends him on several occasions . However , when Christine is abducted by the Phantom , Madame Giry gives up all hope of avoiding her past and helps Raoul de Chagny to the Phantom 's Lair deep underground . She shows him the way , but will not accompany him into the catacombs . In this way , Andrew Lloyd Webber combines the roles of	Madame Giry
645	646	Madame Giry and the Persian from the novel . ( In the novel , the Persian shows Raoul where the Opera Ghost resides - although he does accompany Raoul , unlike Madame Giry . ) They both tell Raoul to hold his hand `` at the level of his eyes '' , to protect from attack with punjab lasso . Madame Giry is not amongst the crowd who enter the Phantom 's Lair at the end of the musical , although her daughter Meg Giry is . In the film version , Richardson is seen playing a non-speaking character in several of the black - and - white scenes , which indicate events many years after the events in the story . Since Raoul uses a wheelchair in these scenes , it is wrongly assumed that she is meant to be an elder Meg , as opposed to Madame Giry .

Former Jurassic World manager Claire Dearing creates a dinosaur rescue organization called the Dinosaur Protection Group and teams up with Benjamin Lockwood , the former partner of John Hammond , to bring the creatures to a sanctuary in America . Claire 's boyfriend Owen Grady , a former dinosaur trainer at the park , joins the mission to locate Blue , the	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
683	684	last of the Velociraptors that he trained . However , after Isla Nublar is destroyed by the eruption , Claire and Owen are betrayed and learn about a greater scheme that emerges when the creatures are being auctioned away at Lockwood 's estate , and disaster strikes when an incredibly dangerous and intelligent hybrid dinosaur , the Indoraptor , escapes and begins a reign of terror across the estate .

684	685	Ian Malcolm , an expert in chaos theory who once consulted for InGen 's Jurassic Park . In a podcast interview , Goldblum revealed of his role `` It 's small ... who knows , they may cut me out entirely ! But if I stay in , I 'll be a sprig of parsley or a little garnish , hopefully with some impact ! '' Director Bayona confirmed that Goldblum 's role is simply a cameo , stating , `` He 's more like a cameo - he does n't have a major role in the action but it 's definitely a very meaningful one in terms of the story . '' Isabella Sermon as Maisie Lockwood , the granddaughter of Benjamin Lockwood . Daniella Pineda as Zia Rodriguez , a paleo - veterinarian in the Dinosaur Protection Group . Kevin Layne as a submarine pilot . Production ( edit ) Development ( edit ) During early conversations on the 2015 film Jurassic World , executive producer Steven Spielberg told director Colin Trevorrow that he was interested in having several more films made . In April 2014 , Trevorrow announced that sequels had been discussed : `` We wanted to create something that would be a little bit less arbitrary and episodic , and something that could potentially arc into a series that would feel like a complete story . '' Trevorrow hinted that Chris Pratt and Omar Sy could reprise their roles for the next few films and	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
685	686	said he would direct the film if asked . Trevorrow later told Spielberg that he would only focus on directing one film in the series . In May 2015 , Trevorrow announced that he would not direct another film in the series : `` I would be involved in some way , but not as director . '' Trevorrow felt that different directors could bring different qualities to future films . Pratt is signed on for future films in the series , as is Ty Simpkins , who portrayed Gray in Jurassic World . On June 3 , 2015 , Trevorrow stated that Jurassic World left many story possibilities open for the sequel 's director that could potentially allow the film to take place in a different location , rather than on an island like previous films . Trevorrow hinted that the next film could involve dinosaurs being used by other companies for non-entertainment purposes , possibly in agriculture , medicine , and war : `` I really like the idea that this group of geneticists are n't the only people who can make a dinosaur ( ... ) when you think of the differences between Apple and PC -- the minute something goes open - source , there are all kinds of entities and interests that may be able to utilize that technology . '' On June 8 , 2015 , Jurassic World producer Frank Marshall met with Trevorrow and Universal Studios to discuss a sequel . Later that	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
686	687	month , Trevorrow did not deny that the film could involve `` dinosaur soldiers '' and said the series is `` not always gon na be about a Jurassic Park '' , saying he felt that future films could explore the idea of dinosaurs and humans co-existing together . Trevorrow also hinted that the next film may not involve the Jurassic World theme park and said he would be interested in seeing a Jurassic Park film made by one of several Spanish horror film directors , whose names he did not mention . Pre-production ( edit ) On July 23 , 2015 , Universal announced that a fifth film is scheduled for a June 22 , 2018 , release date . It was also announced that Trevorrow would write the script with his writing partner Derek Connolly , as they did for Jurassic World ; that the film would be produced by Frank Marshall ; and that Spielberg and Trevorrow would act as executive producers . Universal also said that Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard would reprise their roles from the previous film . At the time of the film 's announcement , Trevorrow said the series `` is n't always going to be limited to theme parks '' and confirmed that the film would not involve `` a bunch of dinosaurs chasing people on an island . That 'll get old real fast . '' Trevorrow also spoke of the film 's possible open - source storyline :	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
687	688	`` It 's almost like InGen is Mac , but what if PC gets their hands on it ? What if there are 15 different entities around the world who can make a dinosaur ? '' In August 2015 , Howard said that the script was being written , and it was announced that the film would be released in the UK two weeks early , on June 7 , 2018 . Later that year , B.D. Wong said he `` would be happy to return '' as Dr. Henry Wu , while Howard announced that filming would begin in 2017 . Howard also said she would be interested in seeing characters from earlier Jurassic Park films return for the fifth film , saying , `` I could see versions of the film where a lot of the characters come back . '' By October 2015 , director J.A. Bayona was being considered to direct the film , although he chose instead to direct the World War Z sequel , a project to which he had already signed on . In January 2016 , it was reported that Bayona could be a candidate to direct the film after he left the World War Z sequel . In March 2016 , London was being scouted as a possible filming location and setting for the film , and it was subsequently announced that filming would take place at a UK studio . On April 14 , 2016 , actor Jeff Goldblum said	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
688	689	he had no plans to appear in the film as his character Ian Malcolm , although he said he was open to the possibility . On April 18 , 2016 , Bayona was announced as the film 's director , with Belén Atienza and Patrick Crowley joining Marshall as producers . Spielberg , Marshall , and Kathleen Kennedy had been impressed by Bayona 's 2012 film , The Impossible , and initially considered having him direct Jurassic World , but he declined as he felt there was not enough time for production . Trevorrow wanted Bayona to direct the film after seeing his 2007 horror film , The Orphanage . After Bayona was hired , Trevorrow said about the film , `` We 're moving it into new territory . J.A. Bayona is an incredible director and I know he 'll push the boundaries of what a ' Jurassic ' movie is . I think it 's important that we take risks . A franchise must evolve or perish . '' In June 2016 , actor Sam Neill was asked if he would return to the series as Dr. Alan Grant and responded , `` You never say never , but I think it 's moved on . It 's different times . '' The film , under the working title of Ancient Futures , was in full pre-production as of July 2016 , with storyboards being designed . Production was scheduled to begin in Hawaii in February 2017 .	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
689	690	Wales was also confirmed as a filming location , including Brecon Beacons and Penbryn . Trevorrow stated that Hawaii would be used as a primary filming location , while U.K. shooting would be limited to studios , without the story taking place there . Trevorrow also said that the film would feature many dinosaurs that were not seen in previous films and denied that the film 's story would involve militarized dinosaurs , which would only be mentioned in the film . For the film 's second half in which dinosaurs are transported by boats to the mainland , Ecuador and Peru had both been scouted as possible filming locations and settings , while Marshall thought that Cabo San Lucas would be ideal , but such locations ultimately did not work for the film 's story . Although the film would be partially shot in England , Spielberg felt that the country was too far from the fictional Isla Nublar to be used as the in - film setting during the second half , as he and the producers did not want the film to focus too much time on a boat . Crowley stated , `` Rather than making it a movie about traveling on a boat , which is not very exciting , you needed to get to the place . '' In September 2016 , Bayona confirmed that the film would be the second chapter in a planned Jurassic World trilogy . Later that year , Marshall	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
690	691	said that Wong was `` probably going to come back , '' while Jurassic World composer Michael Giacchino confirmed that he would return to compose the fifth film . Óscar Faura was announced as the film 's cinematographer at the end of the year . Writing ( edit ) Trevorrow and Connolly began work on the script and devised the basic story during a road trip that they took in June 2015 , immediately after the release of Jurassic World . Having directed Jurassic World , Trevorrow became familiar with how animatronics worked and wrote scenes into the sequel in a way that would allow for their use , as animatronics are incapable of certain actions such as running . In September 2015 , Trevorrow said the film 's story was inspired by a quote from Dr. Alan Grant in the first film : `` Dinosaurs and man , two species separated by 65 million years of evolution , have suddenly been thrown back into the mix together . How can we possibly have the slightest idea of what to expect ? '' In his initial film treatment , Trevorrow had included story elements that Marshall and Crowley considered excessive for a single film , as the producers felt it was also important to include details about Owen and Claire 's lives after the events of Jurassic World . After Bayona was hired , he began reading all of Michael Crichton 's novels -- including Jurassic Park and its sequel	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
691	692	, The Lost World -- for inspiration and `` to try to immerse myself in Crichton 's mind . '' Trevorrow and Connolly began working with Bayona in July 2016 , to perfect the script to the director 's liking . Trevorrow stated that the film would be more `` suspenseful and scary '' than its predecessor : `` It 's just the way it 's designed ; it 's the way the story plays out . I knew I wanted Bayona to direct it long before anyone ever heard that it was a possibility , so the whole thing was just built around his skillset . '' Trevorrow later described the film as `` The Impossible meets The Orphanage with dinosaurs . '' Bayona stated that with the first half of the film set on an island , `` you have what you expect from a Jurassic movie , '' while the second half `` moves to a totally different environment that feels more suspenseful , darker , claustrophobic , and even has this kind of gothic element , which I love . '' Bayona 's concept of gothic suspense for the film was influenced by Alfred Hitchcock films as well as the 1979 film Dracula . Bayona compared the film to The Empire Strikes Back and Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , which were both considered darker than their predecessors . Trevorrow said the film 's dinosaurs would be `` a parable of the treatment	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
692	693	animals receive today : the abuse , medical experimentation , pets , having wild animals in zoos like prisons , the use the military has made of them , animals as weapons . '' Trevorrow later said that with the film 's dinosaur auction , `` The worst instincts of mankind are revealed . The first film was very clearly about corporate greed . This is just about human greed . '' Marshall said that Bayona had incorporated his own ideas into the film 's script , but stated that it is essentially the same original story devised by Trevorrow and Connolly . In September 2016 , Trevorrow said that the film would be based on concepts from the novels and would include dialogue from the first novel . Trevorrow also stated that the story would be heavily inspired by the idea that , `` A mistake made a long time ago just ca n't be undone . '' Among Trevorrow 's ideas was to include Jeff Goldblum 's character of Ian Malcolm , who appeared in the franchise 's earlier films . Goldblum had dialogue from the novel version of his character added into the film 's script . Marshall stated that Trevorrow wrote Malcolm as `` the ' Uh oh , danger , I told you so ' kind of character , '' and Trevorrow said about the character , `` I saw him as kind of Al Gore . He 's got a beard now , and	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
693	694	he 's like , ' I told all of you this was going to be a disaster , and sure enough it is . ' '' Casting ( edit ) In October 2016 , casting was underway for the role of a nine - year - old girl . The following month , Toby Jones and Rafe Spall were in discussions about joining the cast . By that time , Tom Holland -- who previously starred in The Impossible -- had discussed having a possible role in the film , but he did not believe he would be available for filming because of scheduling conflicts . Jones and Spall were cast at the end of the year , along with Justice Smith . Daniella Pineda , Ted Levine and James Cromwell were cast in early 2017 , while Wong confirmed his return as Dr. Henry Wu . To maintain secrecy , the Ancient Futures title was used in the casting phase . During auditions , references to dinosaurs were replaced with animals such as lions and grizzly bears . To convince the studio that Pineda was right for the role of Zia , Bayona had her demonstrate that she could perform comedy and drama scenes , as well as improvisation . Pineda auditioned a total of seven times before receiving the role . She auditioned for Bayona , Atienza , and Crowley , and did not meet the cast until she arrived in England for filming . In March 2017	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
694	695	, Bayona announced that Geraldine Chaplin , who had roles in each of his previous films , had joined the cast . The next month , it was announced that Jeff Goldblum would be reprising his role as Dr. Ian Malcolm from the first two films . Bayona considered Malcolm a `` great character ! '' while Marshall said , `` The world has changed a lot since Ian Malcolm went to Jurassic Park and we need his point of view now more than ever . He told us about chaos theory , he was right . '' Filming ( edit ) Filming began at Langley Business Centre in Slough , England , on February 23 , 2017 . A majority of filming in England took place at Pinewood Studios . Because of its large sound stages , Pinewood Studios was considered perfect for the film 's many interior scenes . After filming concluded in England , production moved to Hawaii , which was used as a primary filming location . Scenes shot in Hawaii were set on Isla Nublar , the fictional island featured in the first and fourth films . Scenes were also expected to be shot at Brecon Beacons National Park in Wales . The film was shot in CinemaScope , and is the first entry in the Jurassic Park series presented in 2.40 : 1 aspect ratio . The film crew made use of Arri Alexa 65 cameras during the course of filming . Spielberg was	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
695	696	shown scenes from the film during production and he offered his opinions to Bayona . During filming and in between takes , Bayona used an iPod to play different types of music on set to inspire the actors during certain scenes , as he had done for his previous films . Bayona also played sound effects from previous films in the series , including a T. rex roar that he sometimes used to get a natural reaction from the actors , who agreed to be scared by Bayona during certain takes to increase authenticity . In particular , Bayona played unexpected sounds and loud music to scare Smith for certain scenes , as his character is portrayed as easily frightened . In April 2017 , scenes were filmed at East Berkshire College in Berkshire , England . Later that month , filming took place at Hartland Park -- formerly the Pyestock jet engine test site -- in Fleet , Hampshire , England . Scenes were scheduled to be filmed on sets at Hawley Common , also in Hampshire . On May 10 , 2017 , it was reported that scenes were being filmed at Rock Barracks military base , near Woodbridge , Suffolk . Goldblum began filming his scenes on the same day . By that time , a leak had stated that the film would center around Blue , the last surviving raptor from Jurassic World , and Owen stopping her from being used for violence . On May	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
696	697	24 , 2017 , scenes were shot at Hampshire 's Blackbushe Airport , which stood in as an American airfield . Filming in the United Kingdom concluded on June 9 , 2017 . Up to that point , Trevorrow was present as an on - set writer for each day of production so he could aid Bayona with any possible script changes . Goldblum shot his scenes at Pinewood Studios , and concluded his shoot on the last day of filming in the United Kingdom . Filming in Hawaii was underway as of June 13 , 2017 . On June 21 , 2017 , filming began at Heʻeia Kea Small Boat Harbor in Heʻeia , Hawaii . More than half of the harbor was closed for filming , which required the use of smoke machines . Scenes were scheduled to be shot at the harbor throughout the end of the month . On June 22 , 2017 , the film 's official title was announced as Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom . At the time , filming was underway at Kualoa Ranch on the Hawaiian island of Oahu . In Hawaii , scenes in which characters are running were filmed with the use of the Edge Arm , a stabilized camera that was attached to a crane , which was mounted to a truck that drove alongside the actors . The specialized camera allowed for scenes to be shot steadily despite the truck driving over rough terrain . The film	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
697	698	includes a scene on Isla Nublar in which Claire and Franklin are riding in a ball - shaped Jurassic World Gyrosphere ride to evade dinosaurs . The scene was shot in Hawaii and England , and Bayona described it as one of the film 's biggest challenges . In Hawaii , the Edge Arm was used to film the actors riding in the Gyrosphere as it was hauled on a trailer to simulate its movement . In England , an outdoor roller coaster track with a drop was constructed for the Gyrosphere , which Howard and Smith rode in to shoot a scene in which the ride plummets off a cliff and into the water surrounding Isla Nublar . The final portion of the scene was shot at Pinewood Studios , where a large indoor tank was constructed and filled with water to depict the submerged ride . Pratt was aided by a diving instructor for the scene , which also involved Howard and Smith underwater . Filming in the tank lasted approximately one week and required 85 crew members . On July 7 , 2017 , filming took place at Oahu 's Hālona Blowhole , where Pratt and Howard shot scenes on a beach . Filming concluded on July 8 , 2017 . Bayona said that making the film was the biggest challenge of his life . Creatures on screen ( edit ) Animatronics were used to depict many of the film 's dinosaurs . The film features more	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
698	699	dinosaurs than any previous film in the series , as Bayona wanted to include several new dinosaurs not previously seen in earlier films , in addition to the fictional Indoraptor . The film also features more animatronic dinosaurs than any previous sequel . The animatronics used in the film were more technologically advanced than in the previous films . Special - effects artist Neal Scanlan served as the film 's creature effects creative supervisor and worked on the animatronic dinosaurs , while David Vickery of Industrial Light & Magic created versions of the dinosaurs through computer - generated imagery ( CGI ) . Scanlan worked closely with Bayona and Vickery to create the creatures . Bayona stated that animatronics `` are very helpful on set , especially for the actors so they have something to perform against . There 's an extra excitement if they can act in front of something real . '' Among the animatronics used was a life - sized Tyrannosaurus rex , built by Scanlan 's team . The animatronic was controlled through joysticks , with the ability to breathe and move its head . Within the film 's story , the T. rex is portrayed as the same individual previously featured in Jurassic Park and Jurassic World . Scanlan 's team also created functional animatronic models of the Indoraptor and Blue . The movements of the Blue animatronic required the work of 15 puppeteers , who were hidden beneath it during filming . The Blue	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
699	700	animatronic 's movements were rehearsed in advance of each scene . Scanlan 's team also made puppeteering aids , rod puppets , and several prop dinosaurs , all created in coordination with Vickery to ensure a consistent result between the practical effects and CGI . After reading fan thoughts on dinosaurs and speaking with children , Bayona realized that dinosaur textures and colors were frequently brought up , and stated , `` I thought that was the area where I could play with . They feel somehow a little bit more exotic and richer in this movie . '' For advice on veterinary procedures and animatronic movements , the filmmakers sought a veterinary surgeon who had experience with African wildlife . Jonathan Cranston , a Gloucestershire veterinary surgeon , was recommended for the position because of his experience with wildlife in South Africa . Cranston advised Bayona and the producers on how to choreograph several scenes to accurately depict complex veterinarian procedures that involved the dinosaurs . Cranston also worked closely with Pratt , Howard , Pineda and Smith to teach them how to perform such procedures . Additionally , Cranston advised the puppeteers on creating subtle and authentic animal movements , and also worked with Bayona on two scenes . Cranston was on set for 12 days , primarily at Pinewood Studios . Release ( edit ) Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom had its premiere at the WiZink Center in Madrid , Spain on May 21 , 2018 .	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
700	701	The film 's worldwide theatrical release is scheduled to begin on June 6 , 2018 , when the film is expected to be released in the United Kingdom . The film is scheduled for release in the United States on June 22 , 2018 . Marketing ( edit ) A six - second clip from the film was released on November 22 , 2017 . The first trailer was teased for release on November 30 , 2017 , but this was later confirmed to be incorrect . Several teaser trailers and a behind - the - scenes featurette of the film were released in early December 2017 , prior to the release of a full - length trailer on December 7 . That month , Universal launched a website for the Dinosaur Protection Group that ultimately included miscellaneous information about the group and its effort to save the island 's dinosaurs , as well as a video featuring Howard , Pineda and Smith as their characters . A second trailer aired during Super Bowl LII on February 4 , 2018 . A 30 - second teaser trailer was released on April 13 , 2018 , announcing the release of a third full trailer on April 18 . Universal spent $185 million on partners for a global marketing campaign , more than double the cost of the previous film 's partner program . The campaign included nine partners which aired television commercials and sold products to promote the film . The	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
701	702	partners included Dairy Queen , Doritos , Dr Pepper , Ferrero SpA , Jeep , Juicy Fruit , Kellogg 's , M&M 's , and Skittles . The global marketing campaign consisted of 1.3 billion items to promote the film , including 100 million boxes of Kellogg 's products and 15 million packages of Kinder Joy candy by Ferrero . Dairy Queen , a returning partner from the previous film , sold `` Jurassic Chomp '' ice cream desserts in collectable cups , while Doritos marketed bags of chips that featured the film 's dinosaurs . Dr Pepper marketed soda cans that featured images of the film 's dinosaurs . For Super Bowl LII , Trevorrow directed a Jeep commercial starring Goldblum and featuring a T. rex . Within 24 hours of its release , the commercial received 39.7 million online views , which was more than any film trailer that was watched online following its Super Bowl LII television debut . Licensing partners included Mattel , Lego , and Funko , all of which created toys based on the film . Mattel produced a variety of toys , including dinosaurs and action figures , as well as Barbie dolls featuring the likeness of Pratt and Howard as their characters . A mobile app titled Jurassic World Facts was released as a tie - in to Mattel 's dinosaur toys , which included symbols that could be scanned to collect facts about each creature . Lego is expected to release	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom

It can be used as a music and video player , digital camera , handheld game device , etc . It connects to the Internet only through Wi - Fi base stations , does not use cellular network data , and is therefore not a smartphone , though it has a similar design to the iPhone and is often referred to as the `` iPhone without a data plan '' . Furthermore , it does not fit in Apple 's iPhone accessories such as their leather cases . As of May 2013 , 100 million iPod Touch units had been sold since 2007 . iPod Touch models are sold by storage space and color , with all	iPod Touch
740	741	models of the same generation typically offering otherwise identical features , processors , and performance , in addition to available operating system upgrades ; an exception was the fifth generation , as the low - end ( 16 GB ) model was initially sold without a rear - facing camera . The current iPod touch is the sixth - generation model , released on July 15 , 2015 . As of September 2017 , the iPod Touch is currently the only product in Apple 's iPod product line , following the discontinuation of the iPod Nano and iPod Shuffle . Following the discontinuation , Apple revised the storage and pricing for the iPod Touch with 32 and 128 GB of storage .

Users type on a virtual keyboard displayed on the	iPod Touch
741	742	screen . Apple operates an online store , allowing users to buy and directly download music , videos and third - party software . From launch , the iPod Touch was described by journalists as an ' iPhone without the phone ' , and each iPod Touch model to date has been introduced with the same release number of iOS as the contemporary iPhone model . As for the iPod . Successive updates to iOS since the initial release in 2007 have released additional features . iPhone OS 2.0 , released on July 11 , 2008 , introduced the App Store , which allowed third - party applications for the first time . iPhone OS 3.0 , released on June 17 , 2009 , added features such as cut , copy , and paste , data tethering and push notification support . iOS 4.0 , released on June 21 , 2010 , introduced iBooks , FaceTime , and multitasking . It dropped support for the first generation iPod Touch . In June 2011 , iOS 5 , the fifth major release of iOS software , was announced at Apple 's WWDC 2011 , which added notification , messaging and reminder features . Apple limited some features , most notably the voice control system Siri , to the iPhone . iOS 6 , which was released on September 19 , 2012 to the fourth and fifth generation iPod Touch models , contains 200 new features including Passbook , Facebook integration and	iPod Touch
742	743	Apple Maps . The fifth generation iPod Touch gained the ability to take panoramic photos , a feature shared with the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 . On June 8 , 2015 , it was announced at the WWDC that the iPod Touch fifth generation would support iOS 9 , along with other A5 devices . This makes the iPod Touch fifth generation the only iPod Touch to support 4 major versions of iOS . Recent iOS updates have been free for owners of supported iPod Touch models , but Apple received criticism for charging iPod Touch owners for versions 2.0 and 3.0 , which iPhone owners received for free , and for excluding certain features from the iPod Touch software that the iPhone included . Apple 's position was that they could add features for free to the iPhone because the revenue from it is accounted for on a subscription basis under accounting rules , rather than as a one time payment . At WWDC in June 2010 , as of iOS 4 , Steve Jobs announced that Apple had `` found a way '' to make subsequent OS upgrades available free to iPod Touch owners . Purchasing content ( edit ) To purchase content on the iPod Touch , the user must create an Apple ID or have an existing account . With this account one may download music and videos from the iTunes Store , apps from the App Store , or books from the iBookstore .	iPod Touch
743	744	An Apple ID account created without a credit card can be used to get free content , and gift cards can be bought to pay for apps instead of using credit cards . This is convenient for users who want to purchase an app , song , video , or E-book , but do not have a credit card . Third - party applications ( edit ) The only official way to obtain third - party applications for the iPod Touch is Apple 's App Store , which is a branch of iTunes Store . The App Store application , available in all versions of iOS from 2.0 onwards , allows users to browse and download applications from a single online repository ( hosted by Apple ) with the iTunes Store . To develop such software , a software development kit ( SDK ) was officially announced on March 6 , 2008 , at an Apple Town Hall meeting . The iOS SDK allows making applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch after paying a fee to join the development team . The developer can then set the price for the applications they develop and will receive 70 % of money earned . Apple retains 30 % of the sale price with no minimum fixed fee . User - made modifications ( edit ) See also : iOS jailbreaking Like all of Apple 's iOS devices , the iPod Touch is a tightly controlled or closed platform . Modifying or	iPod Touch
744	745	replacing the operating system violates the device warranty , communication between apps is limited and controlled , and Apple is the only authorized software vendor . Hackers have attempted to ' jailbreak ' all iOS devices to enable forbidden or unsupported features , such as multitasking in iOS versions before 4.0 , themes for the home screen and the use of software Apple has refused to sell such as a battery percentage indicator . Jailbreaks for the iPod Touch first surfaced a month after the first model was released in September 2007 , when hackers released JailbreakMe 1.0 ( also called `` AppSnapp '' ) to jailbreak iPhone OS 1.1. 1 . This allowed users to install third - party programs on their devices before Apple permitted this . As of August 2014 , each version of iOS on iPod Touches can be jailbroken using tools such as PwnageTool , redsn0w , Absinthe , both versions of evasi0n , and Pangu . Apple 's warranty statement implies that an iPod Touch after jailbreaking or other modification made by unofficial means is not covered by Apple 's warranty . Jailbreaking is a violation of the Terms and Conditions for using iOS . The jailbreaking process can normally be undone by performing a restore through iTunes . Comparison to the iPhone ( edit ) Main article : List of iOS devices The iPod Touch is generally similar to the iPhone . Compared to a same - generation iPhone , an iPod Touch	iPod Touch
745	746	is thinner , lighter and less expensive , while lacking some hardware and software features . Steve Jobs once referred to the iPod Touch as `` training wheels for the iPhone '' . All iPods lack Touch ID , 3D Touch , NFC , GPS , an earpiece speaker and a noise - cancelling microphone . Depending on the generation , the iPod Touch may have a smaller or inferior display and camera ( s ) . Newer models ( 5th and 6th generation ) lack the ambient light sensor that makes automatic brightness available . Older models lack a built in speaker , a microphone , a camera , and a flash . No iPod Touch has a modem through which it can place phone calls or send SMS and MMS . However , 5th and 6th generation models can either piggy - back on iPhones using Continuity or use VOIP and online SMS services to provide this functionality . Requirements ( edit ) As of the 6th Generation iPod Touch : iTunes 12.3 or later macOS 10.8. 5 or later Windows 7 or later Setup and synchronization ( edit ) For iPod Touch units bought before October 12 , 2011 users must own a Mac or PC computer to be able to use the iPod . Users then must install iTunes and connect the iPod through a USB port . The iPod will then be set up in iTunes . New iPods bought after October 12 , 2011	iPod Touch
746	747	have iOS 5.0 preloaded , and allow activation wirelessly , without the need of a PC or Mac . Earlier iPod Touch units must be plugged into a computer to be synced . This will charge the iPod Touch and sync the music library , videos , pictures and backup data . iOS 5 enables the user to do all this from the device and send it to the iCloud service , which supports macOS Lion and later . Battery charging with FireWire ( edit ) Starting with the second generation model , the iPod Touch dropped support charging from the 12 V pin of a FireWire cable . Charging the iPod Touch takes about 2 hours ( 80 per cent capacity ) for fast charge , and full charge takes about 4 hours .

818	819	for the 2012 season . The Ravens defeated the 49ers by the score of 34 -- 31 , handing the 49ers their first Super Bowl loss in franchise history . The game was played on February 3 , 2013 , at Mercedes - Benz Superdome in New Orleans , Louisiana . This was the tenth Super Bowl to be played in New Orleans , equaling Miami 's record of ten in an individual city . For the first time in Super Bowl history , the game featured two brothers coaching against each other -- Jim and John Harbaugh , head coaches of the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens , respectively -- earning it the nickname Harbaugh Bowl . In addition , Super Bowl XLVII was the first to feature two teams that had undefeated records in previous Super Bowl games ( Baltimore , 1 -- 0 ; San Francisco , 5 -- 0 ) . The 49ers , who posted a regular - season record of 11 -- 4 -- 1 , entered the game seeking their sixth Super Bowl win in team history ( and first since Super Bowl XXIX at the end of the 1994 season ) , which would have tied the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most by a franchise . The Ravens , who posted a 10 -- 6 regular - season record , made their second Super Bowl appearance in 12 years , having previously won Super Bowl XXXV . Ray Lewis , the	Super Bowl XLVII
819	820	Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) from that game , as well as the last remaining member of the inaugural Ravens roster from 1996 , also played in this game , his last before his retirement from professional football . Baltimore built a 28 -- 6 lead early in the third quarter before a partial power outage in the Superdome suspended play for 34 minutes ( earning the game the added nickname of the Blackout Bowl ) . After play resumed , San Francisco scored 17 unanswered third - quarter points to cut the Ravens ' lead to 28 -- 23 , and continued to chip away in the fourth quarter . With the Ravens leading late in the game , 34 -- 29 , the 49ers advanced to the Baltimore 7 - yard line just before the two - minute warning but turned the ball over on downs . The Ravens then took an intentional safety in the waning moments of the game to preserve the victory . Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco , who completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards and three touchdowns , became the fourth quarterback in a row to be named Super Bowl MVP , after Drew Brees at Super Bowl XLIV , Aaron Rodgers at Super Bowl XLV , and Eli Manning at Super Bowl XLVI . CBS broadcast the game in the U.S. , and charged an average of $4 Million for a 30 - second commercial during the game , the	Super Bowl XLVII
820	821	highest rate for any Super Bowl . According to Nielsen , Super Bowl XLVII was viewed by an estimated average of 108.69 million people in the United States , with a record 164.1 million tuning into at least six minutes of the game . Beyoncé performed in the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show , which featured a reunion with her fellow members from Destiny 's Child : Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams .

Currently , this phenomenon can only be repeated if	Super Bowl XLVII
821	822	either the Ravens or the New York Jets play against either the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or the New Orleans Saints in a subsequent Super Bowl . Baltimore 's victory made them the only current NFL franchise to have appeared in at least two Super Bowls without ever losing any of their appearances . Host - selection process ( edit ) The Mercedes - Benz Superdome was selected as the host site for Super Bowl XLVII Three cities presented bids for the game : New Orleans , on behalf of Mercedes - Benz Superdome Glendale , Arizona , on behalf of University of Phoenix Stadium Miami Gardens , Florida , on behalf of Sun Life Stadium The league then selected the New Orleans bid during the NFL 's Spring Ownership Meetings in Fort Lauderdale , Florida on May 19 , 2009 . This was the tenth time that the city has hosted the Super Bowl , by far the most by an individual city and once again tying with the Miami area for the most Super Bowls hosted by a metropolitan area . It was the first Super Bowl to be held in New Orleans since the Superdome sustained damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , as well as since the naming rights of the Superdome were sold to Mercedes - Benz while it was undergoing a major renovation in 2011 , including the addition of Champions Square . New Orleans artist Ally Burguieres was selected to design the official medallion	Super Bowl XLVII
822	823	for Super Bowl XLVII , which was included on beads to commemorate the Mardi Gras tradition . Because of the February 3 date of Super Bowl XLVII , the 2013 Mardi Gras calendar in Orleans Parish was changed . Parades scheduled for February 3 and before were moved ahead one week . The same situation occurred in 2002 when the 9 / 11 attacks caused a one - week delay in the 2001 NFL season , resulting in the Super Bowl XXXVI falling within the Mardi Gras parade calendar . Mercedes - Benz Superdome following Super Bowl XLVII This was the 49ers ' second Super Bowl played at the Superdome -- the first being Super Bowl XXIV when they beat the Denver Broncos 55 -- 10 . The 49ers , Broncos and New England Patriots are the only teams so far to play two or more Super Bowls at the Superdome . The 49ers also joined the Broncos and the Colts in playing two Super Bowls at two different stadiums . The 49ers won Super Bowls XXIII and XXIX in Miami at what is now known as Hard Rock Stadium . Nicknames ( edit ) Super Bowl XLVII earned many nicknames , including the `` Bro Bowl '' , `` Harbaugh Bowl '' , `` HarBowl '' , `` Super Baugh '' , `` Brother Bowl '' , and `` Superbro '' , as this was the first Super Bowl featuring brothers as opposing head coaches : Baltimore 's John	Super Bowl XLVII
823	824	Harbaugh and San Francisco 's Jim Harbaugh , whose clubs previously met in a 2011 Thanksgiving Day game , which John Harbaugh 's Ravens won 16 -- 6 , which was also the first time that two brothers had met as rival head coaches in the NFL . Due to a power outage affecting half the stadium during the third quarter , the game has also become known as the `` Blackout Bowl '' . Teams ( edit ) Baltimore Ravens ( edit ) Main article : 2012 Baltimore Ravens season After going 12 -- 4 and reaching the AFC Championship Game in 2011 , only to lose to the New England Patriots when wide receiver Lee Evans dropped a game - winning catch in the end zone and Billy Cundiff missed a potential game - tying 32 - yard field goal , the Ravens advanced further in 2012 to the Super Bowl after recording a 10 -- 6 regular season record . Under head coach John Harbaugh , who was in his fifth season with the team , Baltimore upgraded their roster with players such as defensive backs Sean Considine and Corey Graham , and wide receiver Jacoby Jones . In December 2012 , the Ravens fired offensive coordinator Cam Cameron and promoted quarterbacks coach Jim Caldwell , who was previously the head coach of the Indianapolis Colts from 2009 to 2011 , as the successor . With personnel on both sides of the ball , they finished the	Super Bowl XLVII
824	825	season ranked 10th in points per game ( 24.9 ) , and 12th in fewest points allowed ( 21.5 ) In command of the offense was five - year veteran Joe Flacco , who finished the season with a career - high 3,817 passing yards and 22 touchdowns , with only 10 interceptions . ( Super Bowl XLVII would be one of only two years the AFC team 's quarterback would not be either Tom Brady , Ben Roethlisberger or Peyton Manning between Super Bowls XXXVI and LI ; the other was Super Bowl XXXVII ten years prior , when the 2002 Oakland Raiders were helmed by Rich Gannon . ) His top targets were receivers Anquan Boldin ( 65 receptions , 921 yards , 4 touchdowns ) and Torrey Smith ( 49 receptions , 855 yards , 8 touchdowns ) , along with tight end Dennis Pitta ( 61 receptions , 669 yards , 7 touchdowns ) . Their backfield featured two Pro Bowl selections : halfback Ray Rice and fullback Vonta Leach . Rice rushed for 1,143 yards and 9 touchdowns , while also hauling in 61 receptions for 478 yards and another score . Leach served effectively as his lead blocker and a receiver out of the backfield , catching 21 passes . The Ravens ' offensive line was led by Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda . On special teams , Jones returned 38 kickoffs for 1,116 yards and two touchdowns , giving him a whopping 30.7	Super Bowl XLVII
825	826	yards per return average . He also gained 341 yards and another touchdown returning punts , and caught 30 passes for 406 yards and a score . Rookie kicker Justin Tucker ranked 7th in the NFL in field goal percentage ( 90.9 ) , kicking 30 / 33 field goals and making all 42 of his extra point attempts . Baltimore 's defensive line was anchored by Pro Bowl defensive end Haloti Ngata , who compiled 51 tackles and 5 sacks , along with defensive tackle Arthur Jones ( 47 tackles , 4.5 sacks ) . The Ravens also had an excellent set of linebackers , such as Paul Kruger , Dannell Ellerbe , Jameel McClain , Terrell Suggs , and Ray Lewis . Kruger led the team in sacks with 9 , while Ellerbe added 92 tackles and 4.5 sacks . McClain had 79 tackles . Suggs , a ten - year veteran and five - time Pro Bowl selection , who had missed the first half of the regular season with a partially torn Achilles tendon , made a speedy recovery and was key in the Ravens ' win over the Broncos in the divisional round of the playoffs with 2 sacks on Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning . Lewis , a 17 - year veteran and 13 - time Pro Bowl selection , had missed most of the season with an arm injury , but still managed to rack up 57 tackles in just 6 games . Then	Super Bowl XLVII
826	827	shortly before returning for the playoffs , he announced his plans to retire after the postseason , and promptly went on to amass 44 tackles in Baltimore 's four playoff games . The Ravens secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Ed Reed , the NFL 's all - time leader in interception return yardage . Reed had another statistically successful season in 2012 , recording 58 tackles and 4 interceptions . Cornerback Cary Williams was also a big contributor with 4 interceptions and 75 tackles . The team dedicated their 2012 season to former owner and founder Art Modell , who died on September 6 , 2012 , four days before the first regular season game . San Francisco 49ers ( edit ) Main article : 2012 San Francisco 49ers season The 49ers had recently emerged as a dominant team after nearly a decade of ineptitude . During the ' 80s and ' 90s , they had been one of the NFL top contenders , playing in ten conference championship games and winning five Super Bowls . But after a strong 2002 season , San Francisco went into a dismal slump in which they failed to make the playoffs for eight consecutive seasons . Following the end of the 2010 season , the 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh as their head coach . Harbaugh , who played 14 years in the NFL , joined the team after an impressive 12 -- 1 season as the coach of Stanford , and in his	Super Bowl XLVII
827	828	first season with San Francisco he managed to turn their fortunes around , aided by breakout seasons from quarterback Alex Smith and receiver Michael Crabtree . Smith entered the 2012 season as the starting quarterback , but missed two starts mid-season after suffering a concussion , and second - year backup Colin Kaepernick successfully filled in . A quarterback controversy then began because Smith was ranked third in the NFL in passer rating ( 104.1 ) , led the league in completion percentage ( 70 % ) , and had been 19 -- 5 -- 1 as a starter under Harbaugh , while Kaepernick was considered more dynamic with his scrambling ability and arm strength . After Smith was fully recovered , Harbaugh chose Kaepernick as the starter for the 8 -- 2 -- 1 49ers , but also stated that the assignment was week - to - week and not necessarily permanent . Kaepernick ended up being the starter for the rest of the season and led the team to an 11 -- 4 -- 1 record , throwing for 1,814 yards and 10 touchdowns , with just 3 interceptions and a 98.4 passer rating , while also rushing for 415 yards and 5 touchdowns . San Francisco 's top receiver was Crabtree , who caught 85 passes for a career - high 1,105 yards and 9 touchdowns . Other key contributors to the passing game included tight end Vernon Davis ( 41 receptions for 538 yards and 5	Super Bowl XLVII
828	829	touchdowns ) along with offseason acquired receivers Mario Manningham and Randy Moss . Manningham had been signed away from the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants , while Moss , the NFL 's second all - time leader in receiving yards , had been signed out of retirement after missing the previous season . The 49ers ' backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Frank Gore , who rushed for 1,214 yards and 8 touchdowns , while also catching 28 passes for 234 yards and another score . The team also had a strong offensive line with two Pro Bowl linemen , left tackle Joe Staley and left guard Mike Iupati . On special teams , punter Andy Lee led the NFL in net yards per punt ( 43.2 ) and ranked 5th in gross yards per punt ( 48.1 ) . He planted 36 punts inside the 20 - yard line with just 5 touchbacks . Kicker David Akers had a relatively bad year overall , converting only 69 percent of his field goal attempts , but in the week 1 contest against the Green Bay Packers tied the NFL record for the longest field goal with a successful 63 - yard attempt . The 49ers ' strongest unit was their defense , which ranked 2nd in fewest points allowed per game ( 17.1 ) and sent 6 of their 11 starters to the Pro Bowl . Pro Bowl defensive end Justin Smith led the line with 66 tackles	Super Bowl XLVII
829	830	and 3 sacks . Behind him , all four of the team 's starting linebackers -- Aldon Smith , NaVorro Bowman , Patrick Willis and Ahmad Brooks -- were named to the 2012 All - Pro Team , and all but Brooks made the Pro Bowl . Aldon Smith set a franchise record with 19.5 sacks , more than the rest of the team had combined . Willis ranked second on the team with 120 tackles and picked off two passes , while Bowman 's 149 tackles were second most in the NFL . The 49ers secondary featured Pro Bowl safeties Dashon Goldson and Donte Whitner . Playoffs ( edit ) Main article : 2012 -- 13 NFL playoffs Baltimore finished the season as the AFC North champion and the number 4 seed in the American Football Conference . The Ravens began their playoff run at home against the number 5 seed Indianapolis Colts in the Wild - Card round in what would turn out to be Ray Lewis 's final career home game . They defeated the Colts 24 -- 9 , with Flacco throwing for 288 yards and two touchdowns , while their defense held the Colts to just 9 points , 13 below their regular season average . In the divisional round , the Ravens would face the top - seeded Denver Broncos , who came into the game with an 11 - game winning streak . Baltimore fell behind late in the game , but with	Super Bowl XLVII
830	831	less than a minute left on the clock , Flacco 's 70 - yard touchdown pass to Jacoby Jones sent it into overtime , a play that is known as the Mile High Miracle . An interception by Corey Graham from Peyton Manning late in the first overtime period set up Tucker 's 47 - yard field goal to win the game 1 : 42 into double overtime . Finally , Baltimore advanced to the Super Bowl by overcoming a 13 - 7 halftime deficit and then beating the second - seeded New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game 28 -- 13 , vindicating the Ravens ' loss against New England in the 2011 AFC Championship game , forcing three turnovers total , intercepting two of Tom Brady 's passes , and keeping the Patriots scoreless in the second half . By winning the game , the Ravens handed Brady his first AFC Championship Game loss at home . As the NFC West champion and the number 2 seed in the National Football Conference , San Francisco earned a first - round bye . The 49ers started their playoff run against the number 3 seed Green Bay Packers in the divisional round . Jim Harbaugh 's decision to start Kaepernick for the playoffs came into immediate question when he threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown by Sam Shields on their opening drive , but this turned out to be the only miscue he would make for	Super Bowl XLVII
831	832	the rest of the game , as well as the only interception he would throw until the Super Bowl . By the end of the game , Kaepernick racked up 444 total yards ( more than the entire Packers team ) , including 181 rushing yards , the NFL single game record for rushing yards by a quarterback , as the 49ers went on to win easily , 45 -- 31 . They then faced the top - seeded Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game , where they quickly fell behind 17 -- 0 in the first half . No team in NFC Championship Game history had ever overcome a deficit that large , but the 49ers proved up to the challenge , cutting the score to 24 -- 21 going into the final quarter . Late in the game , their comeback hopes suffered a setback when Crabtree lost a fumble on the 1 - yard line as he was going in for the leading score . However , their defense forced a punt , and Ted Ginn Jr. 's 20 - yard return set up a touchdown run by Gore . The defense then held firm , forcing a turnover on downs at their 10 - yard line to secure the victory . Pregame notes ( edit ) This was the first Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXXVII that did not feature the New England Patriots , Indianapolis Colts , or the Pittsburgh Steelers as the AFC	Super Bowl XLVII
832	833	representatives . Baltimore defeated the Colts and Patriots during the playoffs while the Steelers failed to make the playoffs . By contrast , the NFC had a different member go to the Super Bowl almost every year during that same span , with the New York Giants ( who won Super Bowls XLII and XLVI ) being the only NFC team to make two appearances during that span . With the 49ers making their first Super Bowl appearance since Super Bowl XXIX , this left the Dallas Cowboys ( last appeared in Super Bowl XXX ) , Detroit Lions ( never appeared in a Super Bowl ) , Minnesota Vikings ( last appeared in Super Bowl XI ) and Washington Redskins ( last appeared in Super Bowl XXVI ) as the only NFC teams not to play in a Super Bowl since 1998 , with only the Vikings ( on three occasions ) even advancing to the NFC Championship Game . The 49ers attempted to follow the 2012 World Series championship victory of Major League Baseball 's San Francisco Giants . The last time a metropolitan area won the World Series and Super Bowl in the same season was when the Boston Red Sox won the 2004 World Series followed by the Patriots winning Super Bowl XXXIX . As the 49ers -- who were attempting to join the New York Giants and Green Bay Packers as the only teams to win a Super Bowl in three different decades -- were	Super Bowl XLVII
833	834	the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams , San Francisco elected to wear their red jerseys , which they wore in Super Bowls XIX , XXIII , and XXIX ( wearing an alternate throwback red jersey with three - dimensional numerals in XXIX ) , and gold pants ( worn in their first four Super Bowl appearances ) for the first time since Super Bowl XXIV ( having worn white pants in XXIX along with the aforementioned throwback jerseys ) . The Ravens wore white jerseys as they did in Super Bowl XXXV , but with black pants this time instead of white . Due to the Ravens having their Art Modell memorial patch on the left side of their jerseys , the team wore their Super Bowl XLVII patch on the right side . Much of the pregame media hype centered around the Harbaugh brothers , and how their father Jack , a former college football head coach , raised them . On January 24 , Jack , along with his wife Jackie and daughter Joani , conducted a media conference call , answering questions about John and Jim . Jackie jokingly asked if the game could end in a tie , before stating that the family was staying neutral but remain excited that both John and Jim brought their respective teams to the Super Bowl . The Harbaugh brothers then conducted a joint press conference on the Friday before the game ,	Super Bowl XLVII
834	835	which is unusual for opposing Super Bowl coaches , but it was done because of the historic nature of the game . Broadcasting ( edit ) Television ( edit ) United States ( edit ) The game was carried by CBS in the United States , with Jim Nantz calling play - by - play and Phil Simms as color analyst . For the second consecutive year , a webcast was provided ; this time on CBSSports.com . A special episode of Elementary would be the lead - out program of this Super Bowl . The network 's owned and operated stations in Baltimore and San Francisco , WJZ - TV ( originally an ABC affiliate ) and KPIX - TV respectively , were for many years owned by Westinghouse Broadcasting , which merged with CBS in 1995 . Thus , this became the first CBS - aired Super Bowl to involve two former Westinghouse markets since the merger . Additionally , this Super Bowl gave CBS the distinction of televising both of the Ravens ' appearances ( and victories ) so far ( after Super Bowl XXXV in 2001 ) . The game was later featured as one of the NFL 's Greatest Games under the title `` Change of Momentum '' .

845	846	down to twelve seconds . On fourth down , and after the Ravens then called a timeout of their own , punter Sam Koch fielded the snap in his own end zone . In an effort to kill as much of the twelve remaining seconds on the clock , Koch was instructed not to punt the ball but rather hang on to it and scramble around in the end zone . Koch was able to scramble for eight seconds before giving up an intentional safety by running out of the side of the end zone , leaving just four seconds remaining . On the ensuing free kick , Ginn returned the ball 31 yards , but was tackled at midfield by linebacker Josh Bynes as time expired . Lombardi trophy presentation . Power outage ( edit ) Emergency lights provided some illumination during the power outage . Play was interrupted for 34 minutes because of a 22 - minute partial power outage . Emergency generators provided backup lighting . The fire department ( NOFD ) rescued people from elevator seven , but other elevators were brought to the ground uneventfully . Attendees used double the usual amount of data for their cell phones . AT&T reported 78 gigabytes ( GB ) downloaded from 8 to 9 PM , about double from the peak the year before . NFL chief security officer Jeffrey Miller attributed fans ' calmness to their preoccupation with their electronics . SMG , the Superdome 's management	Super Bowl XLVII
846	847	company , recently upgraded electrical systems at the facility . In an October 15 , 2012 memo , Louisiana officials expressed concern that the equipment bringing electricity into the stadium from utility company Entergy had a `` chance of failure '' . Authorities subsequently spent nearly $1 million on upgrades to the stadium , more than half of that paid to Allstar Electric to upgrade electrical feeder cables . Entergy and SMG both said the problem was in interconnection equipment , and SMG has hired a third party to investigate . Investigations homed in on a newly installed switchgear . Entergy installed a pair of relays made by Rogers Park 's S&C Electric Company of Rogers Park , Chicago to ensure continued power supply in case one supply line failed . One of those relays tripped . Subsequent tests showed one of the relays functioned properly and the other did not . S&C Electric Co. claims the relay 's trip setting was too low , but Entergy claims that the two were set identically . Electricity usage during the game was on par with a regular New Orleans Saints game . The halftime show was powered by a generator that did not impact the stadium 's power . Ray Lewis later stated in an interview that he believed the blackout was part of a conspiracy , saying `` You 're a zillion dollar company and your lights go out ? No . No way . '' 49ers CEO Jed York	Super Bowl XLVII

The constitutions drafted by Jay and Adams for their respective states of New York ( 1777 ) and Massachusetts ( 1780 ) were heavily relied upon when creating language for the US Constitution Jay , Adams and Franklin negotiated the Treaty of Paris ( 1783 ) that would end the American Revolutionary War . Washington was Commander -	Founding Fathers of the United States
878	879	in - Chief of the Continental Army and was President of the Constitutional Convention . Washington , Jay and Franklin are considered the Founding Fathers of U.S. Intelligence by the CIA . All held additional important roles in the early government of the United States , with Washington , Adams , Jefferson , and Madison serving as President . Jay was the nation 's first Chief Justice . Four of these seven - Washington , Jay , Hamilton and Madison - were not signers of the Declaration of Independence . The term Founding Fathers is sometimes used to refer to the Signers of the embossed version of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 . It is not to be confused with the term Framers ; the Framers are defined by the National Archives as those 55 individuals who were appointed to be delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention and took part in drafting the proposed Constitution of the United States . Of the 55 Framers , only 39 were signers of the Constitution . Two further groupings of Founding Fathers include : 1 ) those who signed the Continental Association , a trade ban and one of the colonists ' first collective volleys protesting British control and the Intolerable Acts in 1774 or 2 ) those who signed the Articles of Confederation , the first U.S. constitutional document . The phrase `` Founding Fathers '' is a twentieth - century appellation , coined by Warren G. Harding in 1916 .	Founding Fathers of the United States
879	880	Prior to , and during the 19th century , they were referred to as simply the `` Fathers '' . The term has been used to describe the founders and first settlers of the original royal colonies .

The Stamp Act Congress of 1765 included representatives from nine colonies . The First Continental Congress met briefly in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania in 1774 , consisting of fifty - six delegates from twelve of the thirteen colonies ( excluding Georgia ) that	Founding Fathers of the United States
880	881	became the United States of America . Among them was George Washington , who would soon be drawn out of military retirement to command the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War . Also in attendance was Patrick Henry , and John Adams , who like all delegates were elected by their respective colonial assemblies . Other delegates included Samuel Adams from Massachusetts , John Dickinson from Pennsylvania and New York 's John Jay . This congress in addition to formulating appeals to the British crown , established the Continental Association to administer boycott actions against Britain . When the Second Continental Congress convened on May 10 , 1775 , it essentially reconstituted the First Congress . Many of the same 56 delegates who attended the first meeting participated in the second . New arrivals included Benjamin Franklin and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania , John Hancock of Massachusetts , and John Witherspoon of New Jersey . Hancock was elected Congress President two weeks into the session when Peyton Randolph was recalled to Virginia to preside over the House of Burgesses . Thomas Jefferson replaced Randolph in the Virginia congressional delegation . The second Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence . Witherspoon was the only active clergyman to sign the Declaration . He also signed the Articles of Confederation and attended the New Jersey ( 1787 ) convention that ratified the Federal Constitution . The newly founded country of the United States had to create a new government to replace the	Founding Fathers of the United States
881	882	British Parliament . The U.S. adopted the Articles of Confederation , a declaration that established a national government with a one - house legislature . Its ratification by all thirteen colonies gave the second Congress a new name : the Congress of the Confederation , which met from 1781 to 1789 . Later , the Constitutional Convention took place during the summer of 1787 , in Philadelphia . Although the Convention was called to revise the Articles of Confederation , the intention from the outset for some including James Madison and Alexander Hamilton was to create a new frame of government rather than amending the existing one . The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the Convention . The result of the Convention was the United States Constitution . Interesting facts and commonalities ( edit ) Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States , by Howard Chandler Christy George Washington served as President of the 1787 Constitutional Convention . Benjamin Franklin , an early advocate of colonial unity , was a foundational figure in defining the U.S. ethos and exemplified the emerging nation 's ideals . Alexander Hamilton wrote the Federalist papers with Jay and Madison . John Jay was President of the Continental Congress from 1778 - 1779 and negotiated the Treaty of Paris with Adams and Franklin . James Madison , called the `` Father of the Constitution '' by his contemporaries Peyton Randolph , as President of the Continental Congress , presided	Founding Fathers of the United States
882	883	over creation of the Continental Association . Richard Henry Lee , who introduced the Lee Resolution in the Second Continental Congress calling for the colonies ' independence from Great Britain A Committee of Five , composed of John Adams , Thomas Jefferson , Benjamin Franklin , Roger Sherman , and Robert Livingston , drafted and presented to the Continental Congress what became known as the U.S. Declaration of Independence of July 4 , 1776 . John Hancock , President of the Continental Congress , renowned for his large and stylish signature on the United States Declaration of Independence John Dickinson authored the first draft of the Articles of Confederation in 1776 while serving in the Continental Congress as a delegate from Pennsylvania , and signed them late the following year , after being elected to Congress as a delegate from Delaware . Henry Laurens was President of the Continental Congress when the Articles were passed on November 15 , 1777 . Roger Sherman , the only person who signed all four U.S. historical documents The Founding Fathers represented a cross-section of 18th - century U.S. leadership . Almost all of them were well - educated men of means who were leaders in their communities . Many were also prominent in national affairs . Virtually every one had taken part in the American Revolution ; at least 29 had served in the Continental Army , most of them in positions of command . Scholars have examined the collective biography of them	Founding Fathers of the United States
883	884	as well as the signers of the Declaration and the Constitution . Education ( edit ) Many of the Founding Fathers attended or held degrees from the colonial colleges , most notably Columbia , Princeton , Harvard , the College of William and Mary , Yale and University of Pennsylvania . Some had previously been home schooled or obtained early instruction from private tutors or academies . Others had studied abroad . Ironically , Benjamin Franklin who had little formal education himself would ultimately establish the University of Pennsylvania based on European models ( 1740 ) ; `` Penn '' would have the first medical school ( 1765 ) in the thirteen colonies where another Founder , Benjamin Rush would eventually teach . With a limited number of professional schools established in the U.S. , Founders also sought advanced degrees from traditional institutions in England and Scotland such as the University of Edinburgh and University of St. Andrews . Colleges attended ( edit ) College of William and Mary : Thomas Jefferson Harvard : John Adams , John Hancock and William Williams Columbia : John Jay , Alexander Hamilton , Gouverneur Morris , Robert R. Livingston and Egbert Benson . Princeton : James Madison , Gunning Bedford , Jr. , Aaron Burr , Benjamin Rush and William Paterson University of Pennsylvania : Hugh Williamson Yale University : Oliver Wolcott James Wilson attended University of St. Andrews and Edinburgh though he never received a degree . Advanced degrees and apprenticeships (	Founding Fathers of the United States
884	885	edit ) Doctors of medicine ( edit ) University of Edinburgh : Rush University of Utrecht , Netherlands : Williamson Theology ( edit ) University of Edinburgh : Witherspoon ( attended , no degree ) University of St. Andrews : Witherspoon ( honorary doctorate ) Legal apprenticeships ( edit ) Several like John Jay , James Wilson , John Williams and George Wythe were trained as lawyers through apprenticeships in the colonies while a few trained at the Inns of Court in London . Self - taught or little formal education ( edit ) Franklin , Washington , John Williams and Henry Wisner had little formal education and were largely self - taught or learned through apprenticeship . Demographics ( edit ) Most of the Founding Fathers were natives of the Thirteen Colonies . At least nine were immigrants : four ( Butler , Fitzsimons , McHenry , and Paterson ) from Ireland , two ( Davie and Robert Morris ) from England , two ( Wilson and Witherspoon ) from Scotland , and one ( Hamilton ) from the West Indies . Many of them had moved from one state to another . Eighteen had already lived , studied or worked in more than one state or colony : Baldwin , Bassett , Bedford , Davie , Dickinson , Few , Franklin , Ingersoll , Hamilton , Livingston , Alexander Martin , Luther Martin , Mercer , Gouverneur Morris , Robert Morris , Read , Sherman , and Williamson	Founding Fathers of the United States
885	886	. Several others had studied or traveled abroad . Political experience ( edit ) The Founding Fathers had extensive political experience . Many had been members of the Continental Congress . Nearly all of the 55 Constitutional Convention delegates had experience in colonial and state government , and the majority had held county and local offices . Thomas Mifflin and Nathaniel Gorham had served as President of the Continental Congress . The ones who lacked congressional experience were Bassett , Blair , Brearly , Broom , Davie , Dayton , Alexander Martin , Luther Martin , Mason , McClurg , Paterson , Charles Pinckney , Strong , and Yates . Eight men ( Clymer , Franklin , Gerry , Robert Morris , Read , Roger Sherman , Wilson , and Wythe ) had signed the Declaration of Independence . Six ( Carroll , Dickinson , Gerry , Gouverneur Morris , Robert Morris , and Roger Sherman ) had signed the Articles of Confederation . Two , Sherman and Robert Morris , three of the nation 's historical documents . Dickinson , Franklin , Langdon , and Rutledge had been governors . Occupations and finances ( edit ) Historian Caroline Robbins in 1977 examined the status of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence and concluded : There were indeed disparities of wealth , earned or inherited : some Signers were rich , others had about enough to enable them to attend Congress ... The majority of revolutionaries were from moderately	Founding Fathers of the United States
886	887	well - to - do or average income brackets . Twice as many Loyalists belonged to the wealthiest echelon . But some Signers were rich ; few , indigent ... The Signers were elected not for wealth or rank so much as because of the evidence they had already evinced of willingness for public service . The Founding Fathers practiced a wide range of high and middle - status occupations , and many pursued more than one career simultaneously . They did not differ dramatically from the Loyalists , except they were generally younger and less senior in their professions . A few of them were wealthy or had financial resources that ranged from good to excellent , but there are other founders who were less than wealthy . On the whole they were less wealthy than the Loyalists . As many as thirty - five had legal apprenticeship , though not all of them practiced law . Some had also been local judges . At the time of the convention , 13 men were merchants : Blount , Broom , Clymer , Dayton , Fitzsimons , Shields , Gilman , Gorham , Langdon , Robert Morris , Pierce , Sherman , and Wilson . Seven were major land speculators : Blount , Dayton , Fitzsimmons , Gorham , Robert Morris , Washington , and Wilson . Eleven speculated in securities on a large scale : Bedford , Blair , Clymer , Dayton , Fitzsimons , Franklin , King ,	Founding Fathers of the United States
887	888	Langdon , Robert Morris , Charles Cotesworth Pinckney , and Sherman . Many owned or managed slave - operated plantations or large farms , particularly in the southern colonies : Bassett , Blair , Blount , Davie , Johnson , Butler , Carroll , Jefferson , Jenifer , Madison , Mason , Charles Pinckney , Charles Cotesworth Pinckney , Rutledge , Spaight , and Washington . Many wealthy Northerners owned domestic slaves : Franklin later freed his slaves and was a key founder of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society . Jay founded the New York Manumission Society in 1785 , for which Hamilton became an officer . They and other members of the Society founded the African Free School in New York City , to educate the children of free blacks and slaves . When Jay was governor of New York in 1798 , he signed into law a gradual abolition law ; fully ending slavery as of 1827 . He freed his own slaves in 1798 . Broom and Few were small farmers . Eight of the men received a substantial part of their income from public office : Baldwin , Blair , Brearly , Gilman , Livingston , Madison , and Rutledge . Three had retired from active economic endeavors : Franklin , McHenry , and Mifflin . Franklin and Williamson were scientists , in addition to their other activities . McClurg , McHenry , Rush , and Williamsonwere physicians Johnson and Witherspoon were college presidents . Religion (	Founding Fathers of the United States
888	889	edit ) Franklin T. Lambert ( 2003 ) has examined the religious affiliations and beliefs of the Founders . Of the 55 delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention , 28 were Anglicans ( in the Church of England ; or Episcopalian , after the American Revolutionary War was won ) , 21 were Protestants , and two were Roman Catholics ( D. Carroll , and Fitzsimons ) . Among the Protestant delegates to the Constitutional Convention , eight were Presbyterians , seven were Congregationalists , two were Lutherans , two were Dutch Reformed , and two were Methodists . A few prominent Founding Fathers were anti-clerical Christians such as Thomas Jefferson , who constructed the Jefferson Bible , and Benjamin Franklin . Historian Gregg L. Frazer argues that the leading Founders ( Adams , Jefferson , Franklin , Wilson , Morris , Madison , Hamilton , and Washington ) were neither Christians nor Deists , but rather supporters of a hybrid `` theistic rationalism '' . The Faiths of the Founding Fathers is a book that discusses the religion held by the founding fathers , written in 2006 by historian of U.S. religion David L. Holmes . Ownership of slaves and position on slavery ( edit ) Portrait of George Washington and his valet slave William Lee See also : George Washington and slavery and Thomas Jefferson and slavery One of the greatest contradictions of the Founding Fathers was their disunity with regard to slavery at a time that they	Founding Fathers of the United States
889	890	were seeking liberty for themselves . In her study of Thomas Jefferson , historian Annette Gordon - Reed emphasizes this irony , `` Others of the founders held slaves , but no other founder drafted the charter for freedom , '' In addition to Jefferson , George Washington , John Jay and many other of the Founding Fathers practiced slavery but were also conflicted by the institution which many saw as immoral and politically divisive . Benjamin Franklin owned slaves ( though Franklin later became an abolitionist ) . John Jay would try unsuccessfully to abolish slavery as early as 1777 in the State of New York but was overruled ( though he would later sign the Gradual Emancipation Act into law while Governor ) . Alexander Hamilton opposed slavery , as his experiences in life left him very familiar with slavery and its effect on slaves and on slaveholders , although he did negotiate slave transactions for his wife 's family , the Schuylers . John Adams , Samuel Adams , and Thomas Paine never owned slaves Slaves and slavery are mentioned only indirectly in the 1787 Constitution . For example , Article 1 , Section 2 , Clause 3 prescribes that `` three fifths of all other Persons '' are to be counted for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and direct taxes . Additionally , in Article 4 , Section 2 , Clause 3 , slaves are referred to as `` persons held in	Founding Fathers of the United States
890	891	service or labor '' . The Founding Fathers , however , did make important efforts to contain slavery . Many Northern states had adopted legislation to end or significantly reduce slavery during and after the American Revolution . In 1782 Virginia passed a manumission law that allowed slave owners to free their slaves by will or deed . As a result , thousands of slaves were manumitted in Virginia . Thomas Jefferson , in 1784 , proposed to ban slavery in all the Western Territories , which failed to pass Congress by one vote . Partially following Jefferson 's plan , Congress did ban slavery in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 , for lands north of the Ohio River . The international slave trade was banned in all states except South Carolina , by 1800 . Finally in 1807 , President Jefferson called for and signed into law a Federally - enforced ban on the international slave trade throughout the U.S. and its territories . It became a federal crime to import or export a slave . However , the domestic slave trade was allowed , for expansion , or for diffusion of slavery into the Louisiana Territory . Attendance at conventions ( edit ) In the winter and spring of 1786 -- 1787 , twelve of the thirteen states chose a total of 74 delegates to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia . Nineteen delegates chose not to accept election or attend the debates ; for example , Patrick	Founding Fathers of the United States
891	892	Henry of Virginia thought that state politics were far more interesting and important than national politics , though during the ratification controversy of 1787 -- 1788 he claimed , `` I smelled a rat . '' Rhode Island did not send delegates because of its politicians ' suspicions of the Convention delegates ' motivations . As the colony was founded by Roger Williams as a sanctuary for Baptists , Rhode Island 's absence at the Convention in part explains the absence of Baptist affiliation among those who did attend . Of the 55 who did attend at some point , no more than 38 delegates showed up at one time . Spouses and children ( edit ) Most of the Founding Fathers married and had children . Many of their spouses , like Eliza Schuyler Hamilton , Martha Washington , Abigail Adams , Sarah Livingston Jay , Dolley Madison , Mary White Morris and Catherine Alexander Duer were strong women and made significant contributions of their own to the fight for liberty . Sherman fathered the largest family : 15 children by two wives . At least nine ( Bassett , Brearly , Johnson , Mason , Paterson , Charles Cotesworth Pinckney , Sherman , Wilson , and Wythe ) married more than once . Four ( Baldwin , Gilman , Jenifer , and Alexander Martin ) were lifelong bachelors . Many of the delegates also had children conceived illegitimately . George Washington , `` The Father of our Country	Founding Fathers of the United States
892	893	, '' had no biological descendants . Charters of Freedom and Historical documents of the United States ( edit ) The National Archives and Records Administration also known as NARA , defines U.S. Founding Documents , or Charters of Freedom , as the Declaration of Independence ( 1776 ) , The Constitution ( 1787 ) and the Bill of Rights ( 1791 ) . These original instruments which represent the philosophy of the United States are housed in Washington , D.C. in the NARA Rotunda . The Library of Congress further identifies the Articles of Confederation , also preserved at NARA , as a primary U.S. document . The Articles of Confederation served as the first constitution of the United States until its replacement by the present Constitution on March 4 , 1789 .

Washington , Adams , Jefferson and Madison served in highest U.S. office of President . Jay would be elected to two terms as Governor of New York . Seven ( Fitzsimons , Gorham , Luther Martin ,	Founding Fathers of the United States
896	897	Mifflin , Robert Morris , Pierce , and Wilson ) suffered serious financial reversals that left them in or near bankruptcy . Robert Morris spent three of the last years of his life imprisoned following bad land deals . Two , Blount and Dayton , were involved in possibly treasonous activities . Yet , as they had done before the convention , most of the group continued to render public service , particularly to the new government they had helped to create . Youth and longevity ( edit ) Death age of the Founding Fathers Many of the Founding Fathers were under 40 years old at the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 : James Armistead Lafayette was 15 , Marquis de Lafayette was 18 , Alexander Hamilton was 19 , Aaron Burr was 20 , Gouverneur Morris and Betsy Ross were 24 . The oldest were Benjamin Franklin , 70 and Samuel Whittemore , 81 . Secretary Charles Thomson lived to the age of 94 . Johnson died at 92 . John Adams lived to the age of 90 . A few -- Franklin , Jay , Jefferson , Madison , Hugh Williamson , and George Wythe -- lived into their eighties . Approximately 16 died in their seventies , 21 in their sixties , 8 in their fifties , and 5 in their forties . Three ( Alexander Hamilton , Richard Dobbs Spaight and Button Gwinnett ) were killed in duels . Friends	Founding Fathers of the United States
897	898	and political adversaries John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died on the same day - July 4 , 1826 . The last remaining founders , also called the `` Last of the Romans '' , lived well into the nineteenth century . Founders who were not signatories or delegates ( edit ) The following men and women are also recognized by many as having been founders of the United States based upon their significant contributions to the formation of American nation and democracy . Abigail Adams , advisor , First Lady and mother of a president Ethan Allen , military and political leader in Vermont Richard Allen , African - American bishop John Bartram , botanist , horticulturist and explorer Egbert Benson , politician from New York Elias Boudinot , New Jersey delegate to Continental Congress Aaron Burr , Vice President under Jefferson George Rogers Clark , army general George Clinton , New York governor and Vice President of the U.S Tench Coxe , economist in the Continental Congress William Richardson Davie , delegate to the Constitutional Convention ( leaving before he could sign it ) , and Governor of North Carolina .

899	900	still exist today : Benjamin Franklin founded the University of Pennsylvania , while Jefferson founded the University of Virginia . Benjamin Rush founded Dickinson College and Franklin College , ( today Franklin and Marshall ) as well as the College of Physicians of Philadelphia , the oldest medical society in America . Alexander Hamilton founded the New York Post , as well as the United States Coast Guard . Henry Knox helped found the Society of the Cincinnati in 1783 ; the society was predicated on service as an officer in the Revolutionary War and heredity . Members included Washington , Hamilton and Burr . Other Founders like Sam Adams , John Adams , Franklin and Jay criticized the formation of what they considered to be an elitist body and threat to the Constitution . Franklin would later accept an honorary membership though Jay declined . Scholarship on the founders ( edit ) Articles and books by twenty - first century historians combined with the digitization of primary sources like handwritten letters continue to contribute to an encyclopedic body of knowledge about the Founding Fathers . Living historians whose focus is the Founding Fathers ( edit ) Ron Chernow won the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of George Washington . His bestselling book about Alexander Hamilton inspired the blockbuster musical of the same name . Joseph J. Ellis - According to Ellis , the concept of the Founding Fathers of the U.S. emerged in the 1820s as the last survivors	Founding Fathers of the United States
900	901	died out . Ellis says `` the founders '' , or `` the fathers '' , comprised an aggregate of semi-sacred figures whose particular accomplishments and singular achievements were decidedly less important than their sheer presence as a powerful but faceless symbol of past greatness . For the generation of national leaders coming of age in the 1820s and 1830s -- men like Andrew Jackson , Henry Clay , Daniel Webster , and John C. Calhoun -- `` the founders '' represented a heroic but anonymous abstraction whose long shadow fell across all followers and whose legendary accomplishments defied comparison . `` We can win no laurels in a war for independence , '' Webster acknowledged in 1825 . `` Earlier and worthier hands have gathered them all . Nor are there places for us ... ( as ) the founders of states . Our fathers have filled them . But there remains to us a great duty of defence and preservation . '' Joanne B. Freeman Freeman 's area of expertise is the life and legacy of Alexander Hamilton as well as political culture of the revolutionary and early national eras . Freeman has documented the often opposing visions of the Founding Fathers as they tried to build a new framework for governance , `` Regional distrust , personal animosity , accusation , suspicion , implication , and denouncement -- this was the tenor of national politics from the outset . '' Annette Gordon - Reed is an American	Founding Fathers of the United States
901	902	historian and Harvard Law School professor . She is noted for changing scholarship on Thomas Jefferson regarding his relationship with Sally Hemings and her children . She has studied the challenges facing the Founding Fathers particularly as it relates to their position and actions on slavery . She points out `` the central dilemma at the heart of American democracy : the desire to create a society based on liberty and equality '' that yet does not extend those privileges to all .

Bucharest ( / ˈb ( j ) uː kərɛst / ; Romanian : București ( bukuˈreʃtj ) ( listen ) ) is the capital and largest city of Romania , as well as its cultural , industrial , and financial centre .

Bucharest was first mentioned in	Bucharest
943	944	documents in 1459 . It became the capital of Romania in 1862 and is the centre of Romanian media , culture , and art . Its architecture is a mix of historical ( neo-classical ) , interbellum ( Bauhaus and art deco ) , communist - era and modern . In the period between the two World Wars , the city 's elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nickname of `` Little Paris '' ( Micul Paris ) . Although buildings and districts in the historic city centre were heavily damaged or destroyed by war , earthquakes , and above all Nicolae Ceaușescu 's program of systematization , many survived . In recent years , the city has been experiencing an economic and cultural boom . In 2016 , the historical city centre was listed as `` endangered '' by the World Monuments Watch . According to the 2011 census , 1,883,425 inhabitants live within the city limits , a decrease from the 2002 census . Adding the satellite towns around the urban area , the proposed metropolitan area of Bucharest would have a population of 2.27 million people . According to Eurostat , Bucharest has a functional urban area of 2,412,530 residents ( as of 2015 ) . Bucharest is the sixth - largest city in the European Union by population within city limits , after London , Berlin , Madrid , Rome , and Paris . Economically , Bucharest is the most prosperous	Bucharest
944	945	city in Romania and is one of the main industrial centres and transportation hubs of Eastern Europe . The city has big convention facilities , educational institutes , cultural venues , traditional `` shopping arcades '' , and recreational areas . The city proper is administratively known as the `` Municipality of Bucharest '' ( Municipiul București ) , and has the same administrative level as that of a national county , being further subdivided into six sectors , each governed by a local mayor .

Tradition connects the founding of Bucharest with the name of Bucur , who was a prince , an outlaw , a fisherman , a shepherd , or a hunter , according to	Bucharest
945	946	different legends . In Romanian , the word stem bucurie means `` joy '' ( `` happiness '' ) , and it is believed to be of Dacian origin . Other etymologies are given by early scholars , including the one of an Ottoman traveler , Evliya Çelebi , who said that Bucharest was named after a certain `` Abu - Kariș '' , from the tribe of `` Bani - Kureiș '' . In 1781 , Austrian historian Franz Sulzer claimed that it was related to bucurie ( joy ) , bucuros ( joyful ) , or a se bucura ( to become joyful ) , while an early 19th - century book published in Vienna assumed its name has been derived from `` Bukovie '' , a beech forest . A native or resident of Bucharest is called a `` Bucharester '' ( Romanian : bucureștean ) . History ( edit ) Main articles : History of Bucharest and Timeline of Bucharest Bucharest 's history alternated periods of development and decline from the early settlements in antiquity until its consolidation as the national capital of Romania late in the 19th century . First mentioned as the `` Citadel of București '' in 1459 , it became the residence of the famous Wallachian prince Vlad III the Impaler . Early 18th century woodcut of Bucharest ( 1717 ) Welcoming of the Prince Josias of Saxe - Coburg - Saalfeld in Bucharest ( 1789 ) The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators	Bucharest
946	947	( Phanariotes ) to run the town from the 18th century . A short - lived revolt initiated by Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest . The Old Princely Court ( Curtea Veche ) was erected by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century . Under subsequent rulers , Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court . During the years to come , it competed with Târgoviște on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern Muntenia brought about by the demands of the suzerain power -- the Ottoman Empire . Bucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 ( starting with the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu ) . Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years , and hit by Caragea 's plague in 1813 -- 14 , the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the Habsburg Monarchy ( 1716 , 1737 , 1789 ) and Imperial Russia ( three times between 1768 and 1806 ) . It was placed under Russian administration between 1828 and the Crimean War , with an interlude during the Bucharest - centred 1848 Wallachian revolution . Later , an Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure ( remaining in the city until March 1857 ) . On 23 March 1847 , a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings ,	Bucharest
947	948	destroying a third of the city . Ottoman massacre of Greek irregulars in Bucharest ( August , 1821 ) In 1862 , after Wallachia and Moldavia were united to form the Principality of Romania , Bucharest became the new nation 's capital city . In 1881 , it became the political centre of the newly proclaimed Kingdom of Romania under King Carol I. During the second half of the 19th century , the city 's population increased dramatically , and a new period of urban development began . During this period , gas lighting , horse - drawn trams , and limited electrification were introduced . The Dâmbovița River was also massively channelled in 1883 , thus putting a stop to previously endemic floods like the 1865 flooding of Bucharest . The Fortifications of Bucharest were built . The extravagant architecture and cosmopolitan high culture of this period won Bucharest the nickname of `` Little Paris '' ( Micul Paris ) of the east , with Calea Victoriei as its Champs - Élysées . I.C. Brătianu Boulevard in the 1930s Between 6 December 1916 and November 1918 , the city was occupied by German forces as a result of the Battle of Bucharest , with the official capital temporarily moved to Iași , in the Moldavia region . After World War I , Bucharest became the capital of Greater Romania . In the interwar years , Bucharest 's urban development continued , with the city gaining an average of 30,000	Bucharest
948	949	new residents each year . Also , some of the city 's main landmarks were built in this period , including Arcul de Triumf and Palatul Telefoanelor . However , the Great Depression took its toll on Bucharest 's citizens , culminating in the Grivița Strike of 1933 . Calea Victoriei ( `` Victory Avenue '' ) in 1940 In January 1941 , the city was the scene of the Legionnaires ' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom . As the capital of an Axis country and a major transit point for Axis troops en route to the Eastern Front , Bucharest suffered heavy damage during World War II due to Allied bombings . On 23 August 1944 , Bucharest was the site of the royal coup which brought Romania into the Allied camp . The city suffered a short period of Nazi Luftwaffe bombings , as well as a failed attempt by German troops to regain the city . Bucharest during the early 1960s After the establishment of communism in Romania , the city continued growing . New districts were constructed , most of them dominated by tower blocks . During Nicolae Ceaușescu 's leadership ( 1965 -- 89 ) , much of the historic part of the city was demolished and replaced by `` Socialist realism '' style development : ( 1 ) the Centrul Civic ( the Civic Centre ) and ( 2 ) the Palace of the Parliament , for which an entire historic quarter was razed to	Bucharest
949	950	make way for Ceaușescu 's megalomaniac plans . On 4 March 1977 , an earthquake centered in Vrancea , about 135 km ( 83.89 mi ) away , claimed 1,500 lives and caused further damage to the historic centre . Anti-government protests taking place near the Triumphal Arch in Bucharest ( January , 2017 ) The Romanian Revolution of 1989 began with massive anti-Ceaușescu protests in Timișoara in December 1989 and continued in Bucharest , leading to the overthrow of the Communist regime . Dissatisfied with the postrevolutionary leadership of the National Salvation Front , some student leagues and opposition groups organized large - scale protests in 1990 ( the `` Golaniad '' ) , which were violently suppressed by the miners of Valea Jiului called in by the authorities ( the `` Mineriad '' ) . Several other `` Mineriads '' followed , which finally caused political changes . Since 2000 , the city has been continuously modernized and is still undergoing urban renewal . Residential and commercial developments are underway , particularly in the northern districts ; Bucharest 's old historic centre is being restored . In 2012 , a period of unrest began in Romania , which initially lasted until 2015 and during which numerous protests were held in Bucharest . Later in 2017 -- 2018 Bucharest saw some of the largest protests since the 1989 Revolution . On 10 August 2018 a protest under the motto `` Diaspora at Home '' was held in Bucharest and	Bucharest
950	951	was marked by significant violence , with over 450 persons injured . Treaties signed in Bucharest ( edit ) Treaty of Bucharest , between the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire ending the Russo - Turkish War ( 1806 -- 1812 ) Treaty of Bucharest , between Serbia and Bulgaria ending the Serbo - Bulgarian War Treaty of Bucharest , between Bulgaria , Romania , Serbia , Montenegro , and Greece ending of the Second Balkan War Treaty of Bucharest , a treaty of alliance between Romania and the Entente Powers Treaty of Bucharest , between Romania and the Central Powers Geography ( edit ) General ( edit ) Satellite view of Bucharest in 2005 Forested alley in Herăstrău Park Bucharest is situated on the banks of the Dâmbovița River , which flows into the Argeș River , a tributary of the Danube . Several lakes -- the most important of which are Lake Herăstrău , Lake Floreasca , Lake Tei , and Lake Colentina -- stretch across the northern parts of the city , along the Colentina River , a tributary of the Dâmbovița . In addition , in the centre of the capital is a small artificial lake -- Lake Cișmigiu -- surrounded by the Cișmigiu Gardens . These gardens have a rich history , having been frequented by poets and writers . Opened in 1847 and based on the plans of German architect Carl F.W. Meyer , the gardens are the main recreational facility in the city	Bucharest
951	952	centre . Map of the six constituent sectors of Bucharest Carol Park Besides Cișmigiu , Bucharest parks and gardens include Herăstrău Park and the Botanical Garden . Herăstrău Park is located in the northern part of the city , around Lake Herăstrău , and includes the site the Village Museum . The Botanical Garden , located in the Cotroceni neighborhood a bit west of the city centre , is the largest of its kind in Romania and contains over 10,000 species of plants ( many of them exotic ) ; it originated as the pleasure park of the royal family . Cișmigiu Gardens Lake Văcărești is located in the southern part of the city . Over 190 hectares , including 90 hectares of water , host 97 species of birds , half of them protected by law , and at least seven species of mammals . The lake is surrounded by buildings of flats and is an odd result of human intervention and nature taking its course . The area was a small village that Ceaușescu attempted to convert into a lake . After demolishing the houses and building the concrete basin , the plan was abandoned following the 1989 revolution . For nearly two decades , the area shifted from being an abandoned green space where children could play and sunbathe , to being contested by previous owners of the land there , to being closed for redevelopment into a sports centre . The redevelopment deal failed , and	Bucharest
952	953	over the following years , the green space grew into a unique habitat . In May 2016 , the lake was declared a national park , the Văcărești Nature Park . Since 2015 , Lake Văcărești , dubbed the `` Delta of Bucharest '' , is a protected area . Bucharest is situated in the southeastern corner of the Romanian Plain , in an area once covered by the Vlăsiei Forest , which after it was cleared , gave way for a fertile flatland . As with many cities , Bucharest is traditionally considered to be built upon seven hills , similar to the seven hills of Rome . Bucharest 's seven hills are : Mihai Vodă , Dealul Mitropoliei , Radu Vodă , Cotroceni , Spirei , Văcărești , and Sf . Gheorghe Nou . The city has an area of 226 km ( 87 sq mi ) . The altitude varies from 55.8 m ( 183.1 ft ) at the Dâmbovița bridge in Cățelu , southeastern Bucharest and 91.5 m ( 300.2 ft ) at the Militari church . The city has a roughly round shape , with the centre situated in the cross-way of the main north - south / east - west axes at University Square . The milestone for Romania 's Kilometre Zero is placed just south of University Square in front of the New St. George Church ( Sfântul Gheorghe Nou ) at St. George Square ( Piața Sfântul Gheorghe ) . Bucharest 's	Bucharest
953	954	radius , from University Square to the city limits in all directions , varies from 10 to 12 km ( 6 to 7 mi ) . Until recently , the regions surrounding Bucharest were largely rural , but after 1989 , suburbs started to be built around Bucharest , in the surrounding Ilfov County . Further urban consolidation is expected to take place in the late 2010s , when the `` Bucharest Metropolitan Area '' plan will become operational , incorporating additional communes and cities from the Ilfov and other neighbouring counties . Climate ( edit ) Bucharest has a humid continental climate ( Dfa ) . Owing to its position on the Romanian Plain , the city 's winters can get windy , though some of the winds are mitigated due to urbanisation . Winter temperatures often dip below 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) , sometimes even to − 20 ° C ( − 4 ° F ) . In summer , the average temperature is 23 ° C ( 73 ° F ) ( the average for July and August ) . Temperatures frequently reach 35 to 40 ° C ( 95 to 104 ° F ) in midsummer in the city centre . Although average precipitation and humidity during summer are low , occasional heavy storms occur . During spring and autumn , daytime temperatures vary between 17 and 22 ° C ( 63 and 72 ° F ) , and precipitation during spring	Bucharest

Its population , however , is larger than that of any other Romanian county , hence the power of the Bucharest General Municipality ( Primăria Generală ) , which is the capital 's local government body , is the same as any other Romanian county council . The Municipality of Bucharest , along with the surrounding Ilfov County , is part of the București -- Ilfov development region project , which is equivalent to NUTS - II regions in the European Union and is used both by the EU and the Romanian government for statistical analysis , and to co-ordinate regional development projects and manage funds from the EU . The Bucharest	Bucharest
957	958	- Ilfov development region is not , however , an administrative entity yet . The city government is headed by a general mayor ( Primar General ) . Decisions are approved and discussed by the capital 's General Council ( Consiliu General ) made up of 55 elected councilors . Furthermore , the city is divided into six administrative sectors ( sectoare ) , each of which has its own 27 - seat sectoral council , town hall , and mayor . The powers of the local government over a certain area are , therefore , shared both by the Bucharest municipality and the local sectoral councils with little or no overlapping of authority . The general rule is that the main capital municipality is responsible for citywide utilities such as the water and sewage system , the overall transport system , and the main boulevards , while sectoral town halls manage the contact between individuals and the local government , secondary streets and parks maintenance , schools administration , and cleaning services . The six sectors are numbered from one to six and are disposed radially so that each one has under its administration a certain area of the city centre . They are numbered clockwise and are further divided into sectoral quarters ( cartiere ) which are not part of the official administrative division : Sector 1 ( population 227,717 ) : Dorobanți , Băneasa , Aviației , Pipera , Aviatorilor , Primăverii , Romană , Victoriei ,	Bucharest

Like all other local councils in Romania , the Bucharest sectoral councils , the capital 's general council , and	Bucharest
959	960	the mayors are elected every four years by the population . Additionally , Bucharest has a prefect , who is appointed by Romania 's national government . The prefect is not allowed to be a member of a political party and his role is to represent the national government at the municipal level . The prefect is acting as a liaison official facilitating the implementation of national development plans and governing programs at local level . The prefect of Bucharest ( as of 2014 ) is Paul Nicolae Petrovan . City general council ( edit ) The city 's general council has the following current political composition , based on the results of the 2016 Romanian local elections : Party Seats Current Council Social Democratic Party ( PSD ) 24 Save Romania Union ( USR ) 15 National Liberal Party ( PNL ) 8 People 's Movement Party ( PMP ) Alliance of Liberals and Democrats ( ALDE ) Justice system ( edit ) The Palace of Justice viewed across the Dâmbovița River Bucharest 's judicial system is similar to that of the Romanian counties . Each of the six sectors has its own local first - instance court ( judecătorie ) , while more serious cases are directed to the Bucharest Tribunal ( Tribunalul Bucureşti ) , the city 's municipal court . The Bucharest Court of Appeal ( Curtea de Apel Bucureşti ) judges appeals against decisions taken by first - instance courts and tribunals in Bucharest and	Bucharest
960	961	in five surrounding counties ( Teleorman , Ialomița , Giurgiu , Călărași , and Ilfov ) . Bucharest is also home to Romania 's supreme court , the High Court of Cassation and Justice , as well as to the Constitutional Court of Romania . Bucharest has a municipal police force , the Bucharest Police ( Poliția București ) , which is responsible for policing crime within the whole city , and operates a number of divisions . The Bucharest Police are headquartered on Ștefan cel Mare Blvd. in the city centre , and at precincts throughout the city . From 2004 onwards , each sector city hall also has under its administration a community police force ( Poliția Comunitară ) , dealing with local community issues . Bucharest also houses the general inspectorates of the Gendarmerie and the national police . Crime ( edit ) Main article : Crime in Bucharest Bucharest 's crime rate is rather low in comparison to other European capital cities , with the number of total offenses declining by 51 % between 2000 and 2004 , and by 7 % between 2012 and 2013 . The violent crime rate in Bucharest remains very low , with 11 murders and 983 other violent offenses taking place in 2007 . Although violent crimes fell by 13 % in 2013 compared to 2012 , 19 murders ( 18 of which the suspects were arrested ) were recorded . Although in the 2000s , a number of police	Bucharest
961	962	crackdowns on organized crime gangs occurred , such as the Cămătaru clan , organized crime generally has little impact on public life . Petty crime , however , is more common , particularly in the form of pickpocketing , which occurs mainly on the city 's public transport network . Confidence tricks were common in the 1990s , especially in regards to tourists , but the frequency of these incidents has since declined . However , in general , theft was reduced by 13.6 % in 2013 compared to 2012 . Levels of crime are higher in the southern districts of the city , particularly in Ferentari , a socially disadvantaged area . Although the presence of street children was a problem in Bucharest in the 1990s , their numbers have declined in recent years , now lying at or below the average of major European capital cities . A documentary called Children Underground depicted the life of Romanian street kids in 2001 . An estimated 1,000 street children still inhabit the city , some of whom engage in petty crime and begging . Quality of life ( edit ) Chrissoveloni Bank Dinu Lipatti house As stated by the Mercer international surveys for quality of life in cities around the world , Bucharest occupied the 94th place in 2001 and slipped lower , to the 108th place in 2009 and the 107th place in 2010 . Compared to it , Vienna occupied number one worldwide in 2011 and 2009 .	Bucharest
962	963	Budapest ranked 73rd ( 2010 ) and Sofia 114th ( 2010 ) . Mercer Human Resource Consulting issues yearly a global ranking of the world 's most livable cities based on 39 key quality - of - life issues . Among them : political stability , currency - exchange regulations , political and media censorship , school quality , housing , the environment , and public safety . Mercer collects data worldwide , in 215 cities . The difficult situation of the quality of life in Bucharest is confirmed also by a vast urbanism study , done by the Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism . In 2016 , Bucharest 's urban situation was described as ' critical ' by a Romanian Order of Architects ( OAR ) report that criticised the city 's weak , incoherent and arbitrary public management policies , its elected officials ' lack of transparency and public engagement , as well as its inadequate and unsustainable use of essential urban resources . Bucharest 's historical city centre is listed as `` endangered '' by the World Monuments Watch ( as of 2016 ) . Although many neighbourhoods , particularly in the southern part of the city , lack sufficient green space , being formed of cramped high density block of flats , Bucharest has also many parks , such as Herăstrău Park , Carol Park , Cișmigiu Gardens , Tineretului Park , Titan / Alexandru Ion Cuza Park , Izvor Park , Grădina Icoanei	Bucharest

This decrease is due to low natural increase , but also to a shift in population from the city itself to its smaller satellite towns such as Voluntari , Buftea , and Otopeni . In a study	Bucharest
964	965	published by the United Nations , Bucharest placed 19th in among 28 cities that recorded sharp declines in population from 1990 to the mid-2010s . In particular , the population fell by 3.77 % . The city 's population , according to the 2002 census , was 1,926,334 inhabitants , or 8.9 % of the total population of Romania . A significant number of people commute to the city every day , mostly from the surrounding Ilfov County , but official statistics regarding their numbers do not exist . Bucharest 's population experienced two phases of rapid growth , the first beginning in the late 19th century when the city was consolidated as the national capital and lasting until the Second World War , and the second during the Ceaușescu years ( 1965 -- 1989 ) , when a massive urbanization campaign was launched and many people migrated from rural areas to the capital . At this time , due to Ceaușescu 's decision to ban abortion and contraception , natural increase was also significant . Bucharest is a city of high population density : 8,260 / km ( 21,400 / sq mi ) , owing to the fact that most of the population lives in high - density communist era apartment blocks ( blocuri ) . However , this also depends on the part of the city : the southern boroughs have a higher density than the northern ones . Of the European Union country capital - cities ,	Bucharest
965	966	only Paris and Athens have a higher population density ( see List of European Union cities proper by population density ) . About 96.6 % of the population of Bucharest is Romanian . Other significant ethnic groups are Roma Gypsies , Hungarians , Jews , Turks , Chinese , and Germans . A relatively small number of Bucharesters are of Greek , North American , French , Armenian , Lippovan , and Italian descent . One of the predominantly Greek neighborhoods was Vitan -- where a Jewish population also lived ( with a population of 69,885 ( 10.9 % ) out of the total of 639,040 , as of 1930 census , Jews were the second - largest ethnic group in Bucharest ) ; they were more present in Văcărești and areas around Unirii Square . In terms of religious affiliation , 96.1 % of the population is Romanian Orthodox , 1.2 % is Roman Catholic , 0.5 % is Muslim , and 0.4 % is Romanian Greek Catholic . Despite this , only 18 % of the population , of any religion , attends a place of worship once a week or more . The life expectancy of residents of Bucharest in 2003 -- 2005 was 74.14 years , around two years higher than the Romanian average . Female life expectancy was 77.41 years , in comparison to 70.57 years for males . Economy ( edit ) Main article : Economy of Bucharest Bucharest is the center of the	Bucharest
966	967	Romanian economy and industry , accounting for around 23 % ( 2013 ) of the country 's GDP and about one - quarter of its industrial production , while being inhabited by 9 % of the country 's population . Almost one - third of national taxes is paid by Bucharest 's citizens and companies. . In 2016 , Bucharest had a nominal GDP per - capita € 20,500 , or 122 % that of the European Union average and more than twice the Romanian average . After relative stagnation in the 1990s , the city 's strong economic growth has revitalized infrastructure and led to the development of shopping malls , residential estates , and high - rise office buildings . In January 2013 , Bucharest had an unemployment rate of 2.1 % , significantly lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.8 % . Bucharest 's economy is centered on industry and services , with services particularly growing in importance in the last 10 years . The headquarters of 186,000 firms , including nearly all large Romanian companies , are located in Bucharest . An important source of growth since 2000 has been the city 's rapidly expanding property and construction sector . Bucharest is also Romania 's largest centre for information technology and communications and is home to several software companies operating offshore delivery centres . Romania 's largest stock exchange , the Bucharest Stock Exchange , which was merged in December 2005 with the Bucharest -	Bucharest
967	968	based electronic stock exchange Rasdaq , plays a major role in the city 's economy . International supermarket chains such as Carrefour , Cora , and METRO are operating in Bucharest . The city is undergoing a retail boom , with supermarkets and hypermarkets opened every year ( see supermarkets in Romania ) . Bucharest hosts luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton , Hermes , Gucci , Armani , Hugo Boss , Prada , Calvin Klein , Rolex , Burberry , and many others . Malls and large shopping centres have been built since the late 1990s , such as AFI Palace Cotroceni , Sun Plaza , Băneasa Shopping City , Plaza Romania , Unirea Shopping Center , and Liberty Center . Traditional retail arcades and markets include the one at Obor .

It is made up of the Bucharest Metro , run by Metrorex , as well as a surface transport system run by STB ( Societatea de Transport București , previously known as the RATB ) ,	Bucharest
968	969	which consists of buses , trams , trolleybuses , and light rail . In addition , a private minibus system operates there . As of 2007 , a limit of 10,000 taxicab licenses was imposed . Titan Station , Bucharest Metro Railways ( edit ) Bucharest is the hub of Romania 's national railway network , run by Căile Ferate Române . The main railway station is Gara de Nord ( `` North Station '' ) , which provides connections to all major cities in Romania , as well as international destinations : Belgrade , Sofia , Varna , Chișinău , Kiev , Chernivtsi , Lviv , Thessaloniki , Vienna , Budapest , Istanbul , Moscow , etc . The city has five other railway stations run by CFR , of which the most important are Basarab ( adjacent to North Station ) , Obor , Băneasa , and Progresul . These are in the process of being integrated into a commuter railway serving Bucharest and the surrounding Ilfov County . Seven main lines radiate out of Bucharest . The oldest station in Bucharest is Filaret . It was inaugurated in 1869 , and in 1960 , the communist government turned it in a bus terminal . Air ( edit ) Henri Coandă International Airport Bucharest has two international airports : Henri Coandă International Airport ( IATA : OTP , ICAO : LROP ) , located 16.5 km ( 10.3 mi ) north of the Bucharest city center , in	Bucharest
969	970	the town of Otopeni , Ilfov . It is the busiest airport in Romania , in terms of passenger traffic : 12,807,032 in 2017 . Aurel Vlaicu International Airport ( IATA : BBU , ICAO : LRBS ) is Bucharest 's business and VIP airport . It is situated only 8 km ( 5.0 mi ) north of the Bucharest city center . Roads ( edit ) Victory Avenue ( Calea Victoriei ) , a major avenue in central Bucharest Basarab Overpass Bucharest is a major intersection of Romania 's national road network . A few of the busiest national roads and motorways link the city to all of Romania 's major cities , as well as to neighbouring countries such as Hungary , Bulgaria and Ukraine . The A1 to Pitești , the A2 Sun Motorway to the Dobrogea region and Constanta and the A3 to Ploieşti all start from Bucharest . Union Boulevard ( Bulevardul Unirii ) , one of the most transited road arteries of the city A series of high - capacity boulevards , which generally radiate out from the city centre to the outskirts , provides a framework for the municipal road system . The main axes , which run north - south , east - west and northwest - southeast , as well as one internal and one external ring road , support the bulk of the traffic . The city 's roads are usually very crowded during rush hours , due to an	Bucharest
970	971	increase in car ownership in recent years . In 2013 , the number of cars registered in Bucharest amounted to 1,125,591 . This results in wear and potholes appearing on busy roads , particularly secondary roads , this being identified as one of Bucharest 's main infrastructural problems . A comprehensive effort on behalf of the City Hall to boost road infrastructure was made , and according to the general development plan , 2,000 roads have been repaired by 2008 . On 17 June 2011 , the Basarab Overpass was inaugurated and opened to traffic , thus completing the inner city traffic ring . The overpass took five years to build and is the longest cable - stayed bridge in Romania and the widest such bridge in Europe ; upon completion , traffic on the Grant Bridge and in the Gara de Nord area became noticeably more fluid . Water ( edit ) Although it is situated on the banks of a river , Bucharest has never functioned as a port city , with other Romanian cities such as Constanța and Galați acting as the country 's main ports . The unfinished Danube - Bucharest Canal , which is 73 km ( 45 mi ) long and around 70 % completed , could link Bucharest to the Danube River , and via the Danube - Black Sea Canal , to the Black Sea . Works on the canal were suspended in 1989 , but proposals have been made to resume	Bucharest
971	972	construction as part of the European Strategy for the Danube Region . Culture ( edit ) Main article : Culture of Romania National Library of Romania Bucharest has a growing cultural scene , in fields including the visual arts , performing arts , and nightlife . Unlike other parts of Romania , such as the Black Sea coast or Transylvania , Bucharest 's cultural scene has no defined style , and instead incorporates elements of Romanian and international culture . Landmarks ( edit ) The Palace of the Parliament , one of the largest architectural structures in the world and the largest assembly structure globally . Arcul de Triumf ( The Triumphal Arch ) Interior of the Cărturești Carusel Bookstore The statue of Ion Luca Caragiale near InterContinental Bucharest Bucharest has landmark buildings and monuments . Perhaps the most prominent of these is the Palace of the Parliament , built in the 1980s during the reign of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu . The largest Parliament building in the world , the palace houses the Romanian Parliament ( the Chamber of Deputies , and the Senate ) , as well as the National Museum of Contemporary Art . The building boasts one of the largest convention centres in the world . Another landmark in Bucharest is Arcul de Triumf ( The Triumphal Arch ) , built in its current form in 1935 and modeled after the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . A newer landmark of the city is the Memorial	Bucharest
972	973	of Rebirth , a stylized marble pillar unveiled in 2005 to commemorate the victims of the Romanian Revolution of 1989 , which overthrew Communism . The abstract monument sparked controversy when it was unveiled , being dubbed with names such as `` the olive on the toothpick '' , ( măslina - n scobitoare ) , as many argued that it does not fit in its surroundings and believed that its choice was based on political reasons . The Romanian Athenaeum building is considered to be a symbol of Romanian culture and since 2007 is on the list of the Label of European Heritage sites . InterContinental Bucharest is a high - rise five - star hotel situated near University Square and is also a landmark of the city . The building is designed so that each room has a unique panorama of the city . House of the Spark ( Casa Scânteii ) is a replica of the famous `` Lomonosov '' Moscow State University . This edifice built in the characteristic style of the large - scale Soviet projects , was intended to be representative to the new political regime and to assert the superiority of the Communist doctrine . Construction started in 1952 and was completed in 1957 , a few years after Stalin 's death that occurred in 1953 . Popularly known as Casa Scânteii ( `` House of the Spark '' ) after the name of the official gazette of the Central Committee of the	Bucharest
973	974	Romanian Communist Party , Scânteia , it was made for the purpose of bringing together under one roof all of Bucharest 's official press and publishing houses . It is the only building in Bucharest featuring the `` Hammer and Sickle '' , the Red Star and other communist insignia carved into medallions adorning the façade . Other cultural venues include the National Museum of Art of Romania , Museum of Natural History Grigore Antipa , Museum of the Romanian Peasant ( Muzeul țăranului Român ) , National History Museum , and the Military Museum . Visual arts ( edit ) In terms of visual arts , the city has museums featuring both classical and contemporary Romanian art , as well as selected international works . The National Museum of Art of Romania is perhaps the best - known of Bucharest museums . It is located in the royal palace and features collections of medieval and modern Romanian art , including works by sculptor Constantin Brâncuși , as well as an international collection assembled by the Romanian royal family . Other , smaller , museums contain specialised collections . The Zambaccian Museum , which is situated in the former home of art collector Krikor H. Zambaccian , contains works by well - known Romanian artists and international artists such as Paul Cézanne , Eugène Delacroix , Henri Matisse , Camille Pissarro , and Pablo Picasso . The Gheorghe Tattarescu Museum contains portraits of Romanian revolutionaries in exile such as Gheorghe	Bucharest
974	975	Magheru , ștefan Golescu , and Nicolae Bălcescu , and allegorical compositions with revolutionary ( Romania 's rebirth , 1849 ) and patriotic ( The Principalities ' Unification , 1857 ) themes . Another impressive art collection gathering important Romanian painters , can be found at the Ligia and Pompiliu Macovei residence , which is open to visitors as it is now part of the Bucharest Museum patrimony . The Theodor Pallady Museum is situated in one of the oldest surviving merchant houses in Bucharest and includes works by Romanian painter Theodor Pallady , as well as European and oriental furniture pieces . The Museum of Art Collections contains the collections of Romanian art aficionados , including Krikor Zambaccian and Theodor Pallady . Despite the classical art galleries and museums in the city , a contemporary arts scene also exists . The National Museum of Contemporary Art ( MNAC ) , situated in a wing of the Palace of the Parliament , was opened in 2004 and contains Romanian and international contemporary art . The MNAC also manages the Kalinderu MediaLab , which caters to multimedia and experimental art . Private art galleries are scattered throughout the city centre . The palace of the National Bank of Romania houses the national numismatic collection . Exhibits include banknotes , coins , documents , photographs , maps , silver and gold bullion bars , bullion coins , and dies and moulds . The building was constructed between 1884 and 1890 . The	Bucharest
975	976	thesaurus room contains notable marble decorations . National Bank of Romania National Museum of Art of Romania Museum of Art Collections Romanian Peasant Museum Performing arts ( edit ) Odeon Theater at night Performing arts are some of the strongest cultural elements of Bucharest . The most famous symphony orchestra is National Radio Orchestra of Romania . One of the most prominent buildings is the neoclassical Romanian Athenaeum , which was founded in 1852 , and hosts classical music concerts , the George Enescu Festival , and is home to the George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra . Bucharest is home to the Romanian National Opera and the I.L. Caragiale National Theatre . Another well - known theatre in Bucharest is the State Jewish Theatre , which features plays starring world - renowned Romanian - Jewish actress Maia Morgenstern . Smaller theatres throughout the city cater to specific genres , such as the Comedy Theatre , the Nottara Theatre , the Bulandra Theatre , the Odeon Theatre , and the revue theatre of Constantin Tănase . Music and nightlife ( edit ) Covaci Street in Lipscani Gothic revival Caru ' cu Bere Bucharest is home to Romania 's largest recording labels , and is often the residence of Romanian musicians . Romanian rock bands of the 1970s and 1980s , such as Iris and Holograf , continue to be popular , particularly with the middle - aged , while since the beginning of the 1990s , the hip hop / rap scene	Bucharest
976	977	has developed . Hip - hop bands and artists from Bucharest such as B.U.G. Mafia , Paraziții , and La Familia enjoy national and international recognition . The pop - rock band Taxi have been gaining international respect , as has Spitalul de Urgență 's raucous updating of traditional Romanian music . While many neighbourhood discos play manele , an Oriental - and Roma - influenced genre of music that is particularly popular in Bucharest 's working - class districts , the city has a rich jazz and blues scene , and to an even larger extent , house music / trance and heavy metal / punk scenes . Bucharest 's jazz profile has especially risen since 2002 , with the presence of two venues , Green Hours and Art Jazz , as well as an American presence alongside established Romanians . With no central nightlife strip , entertainment venues are dispersed throughout the city , with clusters in Lipscani and Regie . The city hosts some of the best electronic music clubs in Europe , such as Kristal Glam Club and Studio Martin . Some other notable venues are Fratelli and Control . Cultural events and festivals ( edit ) A number of cultural festivals are held in Bucharest throughout the year , but most festivals take place in June , July , and August . The National Opera organises the International Opera Festival every year in May and June , which includes ensembles and orchestras from all over	Bucharest
977	978	the world . The Romanian Athaeneum Society hosts the George Enescu Festival at locations throughout the city in September every two years ( odd years ) . The Museum of the Romanian Peasant and the Village Museum organise events throughout the year , showcasing Romanian folk arts and crafts . In the 2000s , due to the growing prominence of the Chinese community in Bucharest , Chinese cultural events took place . The first officially organised Chinese festival was the Chinese New Year 's Eve Festival of February 2005 , which took place in Nichita Stănescu Park and was organised by the Bucharest City Hall . In 2005 , Bucharest was the first city in Southeastern Europe to host the international CowParade , which resulted in dozens of decorated cow sculptures being placed across the city . In 2004 , Bucharest imposed in the circle of important festivals in Eastern Europe with the Bucharest International Film Festival , an event widely acknowledged in Europe , having as guests of honor famous names from the world cinema : Andrei Konchalovsky , Danis Tanović , Nikita Mikhalkov , Rutger Hauer , Jerzy Skolimowski , Jan Harlan , Radu Mihăileanu , and many others . Since 2005 , Bucharest has its own contemporary art biennale , the Bucharest Biennale . Romanian Atheneum Concert at the George Enescu Philarmonic Radio Hall ( Romanian : Sala Radio ) Romanian Opera House Romanian Academy headquarters Romanian Academy library Traditional culture ( edit ) Traditional Romanian wooden	Bucharest
978	979	church at Village Museum Traditional Romanian culture continues to have a major influence in arts such as theatre , film , and music . Bucharest has two internationally renowned ethnographic museums , the Museum of the Romanian Peasant and the open - air Dimitrie Gusti National Village Museum , in Herăstrău Park . tI contains 272 authentic buildings and peasant farms from all over Romania . The Museum of the Romanian Peasant was declared the European Museum of the Year in 1996 . Patronized by the Ministry of Culture , the museum preserves and exhibits numerous collections of objects and monuments of material and spiritual culture . The Museum of the Romanian Peasant holds one of the richest collections of peasant objects in Romania , its heritage being nearly 90,000 pieces , those being divided into several collections : ceramics , costumes , textiles , wooden objects , religious objects , customs , etc . The Museum of Romanian History is another important museum in Bucharest , containing a collection of artefacts detailing Romanian history and culture from the prehistoric times , Dacian era , medieval times , and the modern era . Religion ( edit ) Bucharest is the seat of the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church , one of the Eastern Orthodox churches in communion with the Patriarch of Constantinople , and also of its subdivisions , the Metropolis of Muntenia and Dobrudja and the Archbishopric of Bucharest . Orthodox believers consider Demetrius Basarabov to be the	Bucharest
979	980	patron saint of the city . The city is a center for other Christian organizations in Romania , including the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bucharest , established in 1883 , and the Romanian Greek - Catholic Eparchy of Saint Basil the Great , founded in 2014 . Bucharest also hosts 6 synagogues , including the Choral Temple of Bucharest , the Great Synagogue of Bucharest and the Holy Union Temple . The latter was converted into the Museum of the History of the Romanian Jewish Community , while the Great Synagogue and the Choral Temple are both active and hold regular services . A mosque with a capacity of 2,000 people was in the planning stages on 22 -- 30 Expoziției Boulevard . Later the project was abandoned . Palace of the Patriarchate Greek Orthodox Church of Bucharest Roman Catholic Cathedral in Bucharest Italian Roman Catholic Church Anglican Church Architecture ( edit ) The city centre is a mixture of medieval , neoclassical , and art nouveau buildings , as well as ' neo-Romanian ' buildings dating from the beginning of the 20th century and a collection of modern buildings from the 1920s and 1930s . The mostly utilitarian Communist - era architecture dominates most southern boroughs . Recently built contemporary structures such as skyscrapers and office buildings complete the landscape . Historical architecture ( edit ) Țepeș Castle Elisabeta Palace Interbellum apartment block Of the city 's medieval architecture , most of what survived into modern times was destroyed	Bucharest
980	981	by Communist systematization , fire , and military incursions . Some medieval and renaissance edifices remain , the most notable are in the Lipscani area . This precinct contains notable buildings such as Manuc 's Inn ( Hanul lui Manuc ) and the ruins of the Old Court ( Curtea Veche ) ; during the late Middle Ages , this area was the heart of commerce in Bucharest . From the 1970s onwards , the area went through urban decline , and many historical buildings fell into disrepair . In 2005 , the Lipscani area was pedestrianised and is undergoing restoration . The city centre has retained architecture from the late 19th and early 20th centuries , particularly the interwar period , which is often seen as the `` golden age '' of Bucharest architecture . During this time , the city grew in size and wealth , therefore seeking to emulate other large European capitals such as Paris . Much of the architecture of the time belongs to a Modern ( rationalist ) Architecture current , led by Horia Creangă and Marcel Iancu . In Romania , the tendencies of innovation in the architectural language met the need of valorisation and affirmation of the national cultural identity . The Art Nouveau movement finds expression through new architectural style initiated by Ion Mincu and taken over by other prestigious architects who capitalize important references of Romanian laic and medieval ecclesiastical architecture ( for example the Mogoșoaia Palace , the Stavropoleos	Bucharest
981	982	Church or the disappeared church of Văcărești Monastery ) and Romanian folk motifs . Two notable buildings from this time are the Crețulescu Palace , housing cultural institutions including UNESCO 's European Centre for Higher Education , and the Cotroceni Palace , the residence of the Romanian President . Many large - scale constructions such as Gara de Nord , the busiest railway station in the city , National Bank of Romania 's headquarters , and the Telephone Palace date from these times . In the 2000s , historic buildings in the city centre underwent restoration . In some residential areas of the city , particularly in high - income central and northern districts , turn - of - the - 20th - century villas were mostly restored beginning in the late 1990s . Eclectic style -- CEC Palace ( Romanian : Casa de Economii şi Consemnaţiuni ) National Military Circle ( Romanian : Cercul Militar Național ) National Museum of History ( Romanian : Muzeul Național de Istorie ) French Baroque style -- Cantacuzino Palace Kretzulescu Palace Historical building in Sector 3 Regina Elisabeta Boulevard Headquarters of the Romanian Commercial Bank ( Romanian : Banca Comercială Română ) Old mansions ( now several of them embassies ) on Dacia boulevard Mixed timber and brick - built mansion Façade of the University of Bucharest The Frascati building Communist architecture ( edit ) House of the Free Press ( Romanian : Casa Presei Libere ) , built in the 1950s during	Bucharest
982	983	the early years of the communist regime . University Square as it looked like in 1976 . These 2 buildings are the Intercontinental Hotel ( opened 23 May 1971 ) and the National Theathre ( opened 14 December 1973 ) , part of a redevelopment project of the square , executed between 1967 and 1972 . A major part of Bucharest 's architecture is made up of buildings constructed during the Communist era replacing the historical architecture with high - density apartment blocks -- significant portions of the historic center of Bucharest were demolished to construct one of the largest buildings in the world , the Palace of the Parliament ( then officially called the House of the Republic ) . In Nicolae Ceaușescu 's project of systematization , new buildings were built in previously historical areas , which were razed and then built upon . One of the singular examples of this type of architecture is Centrul Civic , a development that replaced a major part of Bucharest 's historic city centre with giant utilitarian buildings , mainly with marble or travertine façades , inspired by North Korean architecture . The mass demolitions that occurred in the 1980s , under which an overall area of eight square kilometres of the historic center of Bucharest were leveled , including monasteries , churches , synagogues , a hospital , and a noted Art Deco sports stadium , changed drastically the appearance of the city . Communist - era architecture can also	Bucharest
983	984	be found in Bucharest 's residential districts , mainly in blocuri , which are high - density apartment blocks that house the majority of the city 's population . There is also communist architecture that was built in the early years of the system , in the late 1940s and 1950s . Buildings constructed in this era followed the Soviet Stalinist trend of Socialist Realism , and include the House of the Free Press ( which was named Casa Scînteii during communism ) . Apartment blocks on Bulevardul Unirii , built between 1984 and 1995 . Standardized apartment blocks built as part of systematization . These particular buildings are part of the Calea Griviței redevelopment project dating to the early 1960s . CET Sud industrial neighbourhood Renovated Plattenbau - like socialist apartment blocks on Dimitrie Cantemir Boulevard , built 1961 - 1962 . Patria Cinema and Communist - era and Art Deco architecture , combined together on the Magheru Boulevard Detail from the Bucharest North Railway station Contemporary architecture ( edit ) Headquarters of the Union of Romanian Architects , an unusual combination of new and old Asmita Gardens residential area Financial Plaza International Business Machines Corporation regional headquarters in Bucharest Corporate buildings Vasile Milea boulevard City Gate Towers , an example of 21st century modern architecture Since the fall of Communism in 1989 , several Communist - era buildings have been refurbished , modernized , and used for other purposes . Perhaps the best example of this is the	Bucharest
984	985	conversion of obsolete retail complexes into shopping malls and commercial centres . These giant , circular halls , which were unofficially called hunger circuses due to the food shortages experienced in the 1980s , were constructed during the Ceaușescu era to act as produce markets and refectories , although most were left unfinished at the time of the revolution . Modern shopping malls such as the Unirea Shopping Center , Bucharest Mall , Plaza Romania , and City Mall emerged on pre-existent structures of former hunger circuses . Another example is the conversion of a large utilitarian construction in Centrul Civic into a Marriott Hotel . This process was accelerated after 2000 , when the city underwent a property boom , and many Communist - era buildings in the city centre became prime real estate due to their location . Many Communist - era apartment blocks have also been refurbished to improve urban appearance . The newest contribution to Bucharest 's architecture took place after the fall of Communism , particularly after 2000 , when the city went through a period of urban renewal -- and architectural revitalization -- on the back of Romania 's economic growth . Buildings from this time are mostly made of glass and steel , and often have more than 10 storeys . Examples include shopping malls ( particularly the Bucharest Mall , a conversion and extension of an abandoned building ) , office buildings , bank headquarters , etc . During the last ten	Bucharest
985	986	years , several high rise office buildings were built , particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the city . Additionally , a trend to add modern wings and façades to historic buildings has occurred , the most prominent example of which is the Bucharest Architects ' Association Building , which is a modern glass - and - steel construction built inside a historic stone façade . In 2013 , the Bucharest skyline enriched with a 137 - m - high office building ( SkyTower of Floreasca City Center ) , currently the tallest building in Romania . Examples of modern skyscrapers built in the 21st century include Bucharest Tower Center , Euro Tower , Nusco Tower , Cathedral Plaza , City Gate Towers , Rin Grand Hotel , Premium Plaza , Bucharest Corporate Center , Millennium Business Center , PGV Tower , Charles de Gaulle Plaza , Business Development Center Bucharest , BRD Tower , and Bucharest Financial Plaza . Despite this development on vertical , Romanian architects avoid designing very tall buildings due to vulnerability to earthquakes . Aside from buildings used for business and institutions , residential developments have also been built , many of which consist of high - rise office buildings and suburban residential communities . An example of a new high rise residential complex is Asmita Gardens . These developments are increasingly prominent in northern Bucharest , which is less densely populated and is home to middle - and upper - class Bucharesters	Bucharest
986	987	due to the process of gentrification . Education ( edit ) Sixteen public universities are in Bucharest , the largest of which are the University of Bucharest , the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies , the Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy , the National University of Political Studies and Public Administration , the University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest and the Politehnica University of Bucharest . These are supplemented by 19 private universities , such as the Romanian - American University and Spiru Haret University , the latter being the largest in Europe with some 302,000 enrolled students in 2009 . Overall , 159 faculties are in 34 universities . Private universities , however , have a mixed reputation due to irregularities in the educational process as well as perceived corruption . In the 2012 QS World University Rankings University of Bucharest was included in the Top 700 universities of the world , together with three other Romanian universities . Also , in recent years , the city has had increasing numbers of foreign students enrolling in its universities . The first modern educational institution was the Princely Academy from Bucharest , founded in 1694 and divided in 1864 to form the present - day University of Bucharest and the Saint Sava National College , both of which are among the most prestigious of their kind in Romania . Over 450 public primary and secondary schools are in the city , all of which are	Bucharest
987	988	administered by the Bucharest Municipal Schooling Inspectorate . Each sector also has its own Schooling Inspectorate , subordinated to the municipal one . Central University Library and the equestrian statue of King Carol I University of Bucharest ( UB ) Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies ( ASE ) Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy ( UMF ) Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism Telecommunications and media ( edit ) The Telephone Palace The city is well - served by a modern landline and mobile network . Offices of Poșta Română , the national postal operator , are spread throughout the city , with the central post office ( Romanian : Oficiul Poștal București 1 ) located at 12 Matei Millo Street . Public telephones are located in many places and are operated by Telekom Romania , a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom and successor of the former monopoly Romtelecom . Bucharest is headquarters of most of the national television networks and national newspapers , radio stations and online news websites . The largest daily newspapers in Bucharest include Evenimentul Zilei , Jurnalul Național , Cotidianul , România Liberă , and Adevărul , while the biggest news websites are Hotnews.ro ( with an English and Spanish version ) , Ziare.com , and Gândul . During the rush hours , tabloid newspapers Click ! , Libertatea , and Cancan are popular for commuters . A number of newspapers and media publications are based in Casa Presei Libere ( The House of	Bucharest
988	989	the Free Press ) , a landmark of northern Bucharest , originally named Casa Scânteii after the Communist Romania - era official newspaper Scînteia . Casa Presei Libere is not the only Bucharest landmark that grew out of the media and communications industry . Palatul Telefoanelor ( `` The Telephone Palace '' ) was the first major modernist building on Calea Victoriei in the city 's centre , and the massive , unfinished communist - era Casa Radio looms over a park a block away from the Opera . English - language newspapers first became available in the early 1930s and reappeared in the 1990s . The two daily English - language newspapers are the Bucharest Daily News and Nine O ' Clock ; several magazines and publications in other languages are available , such as the Hungarian - language daily Új Magyar Szó . Observator Cultural covers the city 's arts , and the free weekly magazines Șapte Seri ( `` Seven Evenings '' ) and B24FUN , list entertainment events . The city is home to the intellectual journal Dilema veche and the satire magazine Academia Cațavencu . Bucharest was the host city of the fourth edition of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2006 . Healthcare ( edit ) Colțea Hospital One of the most modern hospitals in the capital is Colțea that has been re-equipped after a 90 - million - euro investment in 2011 . It specializes in oncological and cardiac disorders . Also ,	Bucharest
989	990	the oldest hospital in Bucharest , Coltea Hospital , was built by Mihai Cantacuzino between 1701 and 1703 , composed of many buildings , each with 12 to 30 beds , a church , three chapels , a school , and doctors ' and teachers ' houses . Another conventional hospital is Pantelimon , which was established in 1733 by Grigore II Ghica . The surface area of the hospital land property was 400,000 m ( 4,305,564 sq ft ) . The hospital had in its inventory a house for infectious diseases and a house for persons with disabilities . Other hospitals or clinics are Bucharest Emergency Hospital , Floreasca Emergency Clinic Hospital , Bucharest University Emergency Hospital , and Fundeni Clinical Institute or Biomedica International and Euroclinic , which are private . Sports ( edit ) National Stadium ( Arena Națională ) Football is the most widely followed sport in Bucharest , with the city having numerous club teams , some of them being known throughout Europe : FCSB , Dinamo or Rapid . Arena Națională , a new stadium inaugurated on 6 September 2011 , hosted the 2012 Europa League Final and has a 55,600 - seat capacity , making it one of the largest stadiums in Southeastern Europe . Romexpo Dome Sport clubs have formed for ice hockey , rugby union , basketball , handball , water polo , and volleyball . The majority of Romanian track and field athletes and most gymnasts are affiliated with clubs	Bucharest
990	991	in Bucharest . The Athletics and many Gymnastics National Championships are held in Bucharest at the Polyvalent Hall , which is also used for other indoor sports such as volleyball and handball . The largest indoor arena in Bucharest is the Romexpo Dome with a seating capacity of 10,000 . It is used for tennis , boxing and kickboxing . Starting in 2007 , Bucharest has hosted annual races along a temporary urban track surrounding the Palace of the Parliament , called Bucharest Ring . The competition is called the Bucharest City Challenge , and has hosted FIA GT , FIA GT3 , British F3 , and Logan Cup races in 2007 and 2008 . The 2009 and 2010 edition have not been held in Bucharest due to a lawsuit . Bucharest GP , owned by the controversial businessman Nicolae Șerbu , won the lawsuit that it initiated and will host city races around the Parliament starting 2011 with the Auto GP . Every year , Bucharest hosts the BRD Năstase Țiriac Trophy international tennis tournament , which is included in the ATP Tour . The outdoor tournament is hosted by the tennis complex BNR Arenas . Ice hockey games are held at the Mihai Flamaropol Arena , which holds 8,000 spectators . Rugby games are held in different locations , but the most modern stadium is Arcul de Triumf Stadium , which is also home to the Romanian national rugby team .
